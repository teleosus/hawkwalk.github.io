            <p><span">Health and fitness needs to be high on our list of
                priorities since the "gifts" of mind, body and spirit
                are our greatest assets. Is it not strange that we are
                more concerned and take better care of our various modes
                of transportation than we do of our own body? Or better
                care of the externals of life as opposed to our inner
                stability.</span"></p>
            <p><span">No longer is it a contention, a "maybe" that the
                triad of the&nbsp;mind, body and spirit are connected.
                Since this is so, there is a need to investigate,
                inquire and probe as to&nbsp;how the mind, body and
                spirit work together&nbsp;to help us in&nbsp;achieving
                a&nbsp;life of balance, harmony and peace. To ignore the
                importance of this;&nbsp;is to do so at ones' own peril.</span"></p>
            <p><span">How lackadaisical we are and "yes" even lazy when
                it comes to the maintenance and the nourishment of the
                mind, body and spirit. We turn a blind eye and a deaf
                ear to the influences that are the harbingers of the
                many maladies and disorders that threaten the state of
                our well-being.</span"></p>
            <p><span">In the face of these ever increasing "risk
                factors", we speak words of utter nonsense when old
                habits are challenged. In a cavalier manner, we say; "I
                will die happy doing the things I like who wants to live
                to be old and feeble anyway? Or the words; "I know
                someone who lived to be one hundred years old. They
                smoked, drank and chased everything in skirts. And when
                they died, they died with a smile on their face." How
                touching! Both statements are a cop-out and they demean
                the inherit "gifts" of the mind, body and spirit.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Many; to many of our health problems&nbsp;we bring
                down on ourselves from out of our past and present
                ill-fated habits and lifestyles. The words;"what one
                sows, one reaps" are never truer than when we take into
                account how we have not given due attention to the
                proper maintenance and care of our personal health.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Recently, I noticed a cartoon and its' caption. It
                showed two westerners walking down a jungle path. Off to
                one side were two lions in the bush.</span"></p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><span">One lion said to the other lion. "No", I
                    wouldn't eat either one of them. They are full of
                    Preservatives".</span"></p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span">That is not all we fill our bodies with in today's
                living. We abuse our bodies on a daily basis by
                ingesting all sorts of strange liquids and even stranger
                forms of matter. We have substituted a balanced diet
                with eating habits that no self-respecting four-legged
                animal would dream of copying. At the same time we
                ignore the need to do even a minimal amount of exercise
                to keep the skeletal and muscle structures in shape.
                Some believe "elbow bending" and the "remote control
                button" afford enough exercise. Maybe these two should
                be included as Olympic events,</span"></p>
            <p><span">Probably we should mention something about
                sleeping habits. In many cases what we consider to be an
                adequate nights' sleep falls short of the goal. If we
                were told that one of the requirements to hold a
                particular job was to get as little sleep as possible.
                We would protest vehemently, shouting that our rights
                were being violated. Yet we allow our own personal
                habits and life-styles to deprive us of the much-needed
                sleep that our mind, body and spirit need to restore and
                heal our depleted energy levels.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Add this to our frenetic merry-go-round existence
                as we reach for the "golden rings". Believing that
                within these externals, ones' identity, happiness and
                our very life can be found. It is no accident that we
                have become "fragmented people". Fragmented in mind,
                body and spirit. It is not surprising that there are
                times we feel alienated not only from ourselves but from
                others as well.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Several days ago, after speaking to a group of
                students who were studying English. One of them handed
                me a piece of paper that had these words written;</span"></p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><span">"Do you know how it feels to be lost and
                    alone? <span">If the world is&nbsp;a stage and you
                      are left in the wings.&nbsp; </span"></span"></p>
                <p><span">Or&nbsp;when you feel like a song and&nbsp;no
                    one wants to hear you sing. Do you know how it
                    feels"?</span"></p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span">To live in a state of well-ness, to have a
                well-being we need to look to the choices we make, the
                life-styles we adopt. We either focus in on those things
                that engender and promote balance, harmony and peace. Or
                we&nbsp;choose their counterparts and live a life of
                "quiet desperation" or maybe not so quiet. As we have
                said; we create our own&nbsp;world.The world we choose
                to live in which inversely creates in us a limiting
                factor binding us to a self-image that is incomplete.
                Sadly we accept and believe it to be our "Real Nature".
                In this ongoing process we furnish our "comfort zones"
                the way we want them. Making it almost&nbsp;impossible
                to make the needed change to become and be all that we
                can be and are.</span"></p>
            <p><span">If our lives are lackluster, dull, lifeless,
                painful or meaningless. It is time to ask ourselves,
                "why is this so"? Is this really the way I want to live
                out my life? We know that the solution to any problem
                lies within the problem itself. Herein lies our hope; we
                can remain our own problem while we moan and groan
                and&nbsp;even find someone or something to blame. Or we
                can <strong>become and be,</strong> the problem no
                more. And go on to a more excellent, a more meaningful
                way of living.</span"></p>
            <p><span">To be well, to be "whole", to be healthy in mind,
                body and spirit. Another triad needs&nbsp;to be
                considered. The following three things are three
                suggestions that most every mother tries to teach her
                children.</span"></p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><span">1. To eat properly<br>
                    2. To exercise daily<br>
                    3. To get a proper nights sleep </span"></p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span">Sounds simple enough, right? But how many do
                {do}these simple suggestions.&nbsp;Do&nbsp;pay
                attention, taking them to heart and finding out what
                they can mean to their well-being. Lets' take each of
                these basic essentials, one by one. Commonsense tells us
                that for us to maintain a high level of energy that we
                need to perform all the various tasks we as humans have
                chosen to be of importance. Proper nutrition is needed
                to supply the fuel to maintain the body machine.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Someone has said;" we are what we eat". I would
                add," some live to eat while others eat to live". Many
                would agree with the first quote as for myself, I eat to
                live. The "stuffers" of the world those who shovel the
                food in as though they were stoking a locomotive or as
                if it were their last meal. May be closer to the truth
                than they realize, it may well be their last meal.
                Obesity is on the rise with its accompanying entourage
                of high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, diabetes,
                gout and the killer heart disease. It is hard to believe
                that people play so "fast and loose"&nbsp;with their
                lives. Unless obesity is caused by a glandular or some
                other physical abnormality there is really no one or
                anything to blame except oneself.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Back in the sixties: I knew someone who weighed
                over 325 lbs. He had trouble just to get in and out of a
                chair or in going up a flight of stairs, Many of the
                simplest of things demanded a Herculean effort on his
                part. One day after many broken promises and
                resolutions, he decided to lose weight. His goal was to
                reach a weight of 175 lbs. He also decided that he would
                not buy any new clothes until he had reached his desired
                weight. The months went by and the pounds with them.
                Almost twelve months to the day, a new person emerged
                out of the old.&nbsp;New clothes were bought, a new car,
                a sporty BMW, a new hairstyle and a new personality. The
                transformation was unbelievable. When asked how he did
                it; he said; "I just stopped kidding myself that I could
                lose the weight anytime I felt like it". And faced up to
                the fact that if it was to be done. I was the only one
                who could do it. Plus I was getting tired of carrying
                around an extra person".&nbsp; The rest of the story; he
                also got a new wife.</span"></p>
            <p><span">The bottom line, if you want to change, whatever,
                <strong>"Just do it".</strong></span"></p>
            <p><span">The second basic building block for maintaining a
                healthy body is exercise. A word which many have grown
                to ignore and dislike. Proper exercise is important for
                the skeletal and muscular structure of the body. If we
                don't exercise we will lose our tone, as flab replaces
                muscle. Also we will suffer in a loss of strength,
                stamina and endurance without a minimum amount of
                exercise. As they do say; "if we don't use it, we lose
                it"</span"></p>
            <p><span">The magic word to remember when we are talking
                about exercise is "consistency". We need a plan and we
                need to work the plan. A companion word with consistency
                is "determination". And I guess we need to include,
                "desire and discipline" if we are going to get serious
                about exercising as a life plan. The original question
                asked about longevity? No exercise, no longevity</span"></p>
            <p><span">What kind of exercise, how to exercise, how often,
                must be a personal choice. But whatever it is it needs
                to be something one can live with and do on a daily
                basis. Fitness and exercise must become a way of life, a
                posturing and&nbsp;a "breathing". By this I mean fitness
                must become as important as breathing. From a personal
                standpoint; I do a routine of stretching, stomach
                crunches, push-ups and working out with the five pound
                staff I carry. Plus the daily walking with and without
                the backpack {70-100&nbsp;lbs.}. I used to carry 100lbs
                but since India I have reduced the pack 25lbs. Sometimes
                if lucky I get to play some tennis and half court
                basketball. To put it another way, I think "well-being".
                I am,"well-being"; I assume the "presence" of wellness.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Old habits die hard but again the benefits far
                exceed the initial difficulty of making the change. The
                favorite excuse I hear all the time when the subject
                turns to exercise." I am to busy, I have no time and
                when I do, I am to "tired". If we want to do something
                bad enough we will always find the time. I believe the
                greatest "nemesis" to exercising is down right
                "laziness". I have yet to meet a person who has
                seriously decided and stuck with his decision to
                exercise. That has not said;" I feel better than I have
                ever felt in my entire&nbsp;life".</span"></p>
            <p><span">As we know; there are all sorts of addictions; one
                of the better, the most productive is to be addicted to
                those things that engender and enhance
                ones'&nbsp;well-being.</span"></p>
            <p><span">The last building block is an adequate time for
                sleeping. The body needs "downtime", a chance to restore
                and replenish the depletion of energy that one expels
                during the day. To run an engine with little or no fuel,
                no oil lubricant and allowing it no "timeout"; a resting
                period will eventually ruin the engine. The body is no
                different for it is during sleep;that the restorative
                powers of the body are replenished to help in the
                healing of the wear and tear of the day. One of the
                worst injustices done to the body is depriving it of
                proper sleep. One of the important techniques used in
                brainwashing is the deprivation of sleep.</span"></p>
            <p><span">All that has been said up to now about the need
                for proper nutrition, proper exercise and proper sleep
                for the healing and restoration of our physical vehicle.
                Also applies when we speak about the mind. Both the body
                and the mind are forms of matter manifested out of the
                unmanifested. Relatively speaking since we live in time
                and space, the mind as the upper echelon of
                the&nbsp;body needs the proper nourishment {right
                thoughts, feelings and emotions} those very things that
                can help in the developing of the ways, means and
                instruments so that we might better "self-remember" as
                to 'who we are.' As well as remembering the "Source" of
                our mind and body.</span"></p>
            <p><span">We spoke about the need of the body to
                exercise.&nbsp;The mind also has&nbsp;a&nbsp;need to
                stretch; to ask, probe, seek and search for a "way" to
                reach out beyond the mind into the levels of
                consciousness that can afford us a possibility of new
                insights into new paradigms. To lead us out of our
                present dilemma of fragmentation and separateness
                towards a unity with "All and Everything". Atrophy of
                mind can happen as subtly and as easily as it does to
                the body. The break down of both of these fields of
                energy {mind and body} is a source of much of our
                suffering and pain. Vigilance is one of the words we
                need to practice.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Aging need not be a negative attitude but rather a
                time to enjoy the moment and reflect on the joys of
                wisdom and truth. Age should not be considered a
                liability but instead an asset. A period to expand, to
                go beyond our safe havens and enter into the wonders of
                the unknown. Many of our years prior to the "autumn" of
                our lives we spend bound by the "known"&nbsp;of&nbsp;our
                time. With fleeting moments&nbsp;of&nbsp;suspecting
                there is more to life than what we think, see or feel.
                More than the World we have created for ourselves. More
                than the transitory externals that we cling too,
                defensively out of fear.&nbsp;</span"></p>
            <p><span">If there is a need for the body to have a "time
                out" period, there is even a greater need for us to set
                aside a time for the mind to seek refuge from the
                constant "chattering'' within. Three words and their
                meaning need to be investigated and considered for the
                health of the mind; the three words are; concentration,
                contemplation and meditation. It is within
                these&nbsp;three, a healing and restoration can take
                place. Not just in the mind&nbsp;but throughout the
                body.</span"></p>
            <p><span">This leads us to the last building block in the
                triad of "mind, body and spirit". As said before; "words
                create words". Which in a sense is unavoidable but
                necessary. It is imperative that we are aware, that our
                consensual languages are inadequate. Because our minds
                at this point in time are as we have said; fragmented.
                Unable to consistently separate the unreal from the
                real; the truth from the false and the light from the
                dark. But we are working on it.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Whether we believe or do not believe that the
                human species is part spirit as well as being mind and
                body is one of personal choice. One either believes
                he/she is more than ones' mind and body. That life is
                more than just existing. More than eating, sleeping and
                the performing of the many routines we have conditioned
                ourselves to participate in. More than the pain/pleasure
                cycle. More than the fears and desires which we have
                allowed to bind us.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Or we believe that death is the "end all" of end
                alls. That everything is for naught, that there is no
                rhyme or reason for life. No meaning, no purpose or goal
                that life is just one great big "joke"; a "comedy of
                errors" played out by a bunch of misguided fools who
                believe that there is more to life than meets the eye.</span"></p>
            <p><span">The wonder, we are not doomed, we have not been
                left defenseless, without the inherit resources to cope,
                to adapt, to go beyond the transitory circumstances
                whatever they maybe. Each has within "the gifts"; the
                Power, the Force, and the Will. Choose well, always
                remembering there is no name for the nameless. It just
                is.</span"></p>
            <p><span">Deep within our "Absolute Nature" the Power, the
                Force, the Will, the Truth, the Love is waiting to be
                "incarnated", if we will consciously decide and
                consciously make the effort to become and be who and
                what we have always been, the" very substance of the
                very substance"; One of the One.</span"></p>
            <p><span">The secret of longevity, fitness and health lies
                within the investigation, the inquiry and the probing
                into the meaning behind, in and through, above and
                below. As to what is "Truth", what is relative, what is
                Absolute, what is temporary, what is permanent? Who am
                I? Why am I here? And where am I going?</span"></p>
            <p><span">I will end with a legacy of twelve words; I have
                spent a lifetime with these words;</span"></p>
