 am confused by your use of so many different names, when you speak 
about "who we are", The "Higher Self", "The Inner Guide", "The Imago 
Deo", "The Realized Self", "The Absolute Nature", "The 
Over-Self"&nbsp;et cetera. Can you clarify?</span></strong></em></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="left" colspan="2" valign="top">
			<p><span color="#cc6600"  style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><span> WHAT'S IN A NAME</span></p>

			<p><span>The names are many. And 
as time moves on, there will be many more given to the 
"&nbsp;Ineffable"&nbsp;We can not repeat it often enough; there are no 
words to define the "Ineffable". The words&nbsp;used, when speaking 
about such&nbsp;things are beyond time and space, beyond the body, 
and&nbsp;mind. Beyond thought and conceptualization. They are only an 
attempt to energize a process of enquiry as to "who we are" and "why we 
are here"</span></p>

			<p><span>When we speak about the 
self, or about acquiring self-knowledge and self- understanding, so that
 we might better know&nbsp;our true identity, as to "who we are"? We 
find ourselves in an area, where words become inadequate for descriptive
 purposes. But even this being so; we should continue ceaselessly to 
speak or write about "Reality". Even though our thinking is at best 
fragmentary.</span></p>

			<p><span">As we evolve individually or 
collectively, so will our "expressions" about "Reality". We must 
continually keep reminding ourselves that our knowledge and our wisdom 
about the known, in comparison&nbsp;to the unknown is staggering to say 
the least.</span></p>

			<p><span>Sorry for the slight 
detour, back to the central problem of "cataloguing" "categorizing and 
"classifying" the "Ineffable". As long we are caught and bound, by time 
and space. And have this problem of fragmentary thinking. We have to 
seek out another route. There is always that standby of "Faith", along 
with an adherence to a specified religion. But here also, is that 
language problem in the use of words to define the undefinable.</span><span">&nbsp;</span></p>

			<p><span">Is there another option, or route?</span></p>

			<p><span>How do we bypass the 
restrictions and limitations of the mind, with its' patterns of logical 
sequential thought? Is it possible? Yes!</span></p>

			<p><span>By <strong>experiencing</strong>
 the indescribable, the unfathomable, the unknown, that which has no 
shape, no form, no name, the undefinable, the changeless, the timeless, 
that which has no beginning and no end.</span></p>

			<p><span>"Be still and know," That I am "That" I Am". Describe, we cannot. Experience, we can. "Seek, ask and knock" are the mandates.</span></p>

			<p><span>Learn about, who you are 
now? How you have become who you believe yourself to be. So you can 
become what you have always been.&nbsp;Who you really are. Here we go 
again, we are talking about self-knowledge and self-understanding, about
 becoming and being. In comes that paradoxical saying; "to gain ones' 
life, one has to lose it". Lose those things that hinder, prevent and 
block. Those things that dwarfs ones' "true Self", ones'" Absolute 
Nature", their "Imago Deo". As you search out this elusive "Self", you 
will come across many names by which it is called. But do not be lulled 
by the verbiage. Words are not the vessel to hold the "Infinite". But 
you are.</span></p>

			<p><span>To find ones' "Self" look
 inward, deep inside in the silence of you. "Be still and know" that the
 "I am" within, will lead you to the "I AM THAT I AM" and the return 
"Home" will be complete.</span></p>

			<p><span>To find out who you are, 
you need to find out who you are not. This calls for the act of 
self-remembering, i.e., learning to see yourself as the experiencer, 
experiencing, the experience. As, to what is happening and how the 
experience is affecting you the experiencer. And how you are affecting 
the experience.</span></p>

			<p><span>Out of this new learning 
experience, a new way of perceiving ourselves, others, the world and the
 things of the world, comes center stage. This experiential perception 
moves from the subjective to the objective. Moving out beyond the 
experiencer and the experience to a state of "awareness. Which gives our
 seeing, thinking, and feeling a greater intensity. An,"objectivity" 
that we seldom use. Because, we are caught up in our own subjectivity 
and self-identification, which we have with all manner of things. This 
new awareness means attending to the moment at hand, the "Now". To the "
 is-ness" and the "thus-ness" of that which is being experienced. A 
focusing, a centering, an unswerving attention, which allows one to see 
both the subject and the object as one. And in the "Light" of this, we 
draw closer to the "Source" of this "is-ness" and "thus-ness of the 
moment. Fragmentation and duality give way to REALITY and UNITY.</span></p>

			<p><span>But to repeat, do not let
 words fool you. They are but words. Words can never define "Reality". 
One must sense, intuit if you like that which is behind, above, below 
and beyond the word. This calls for one to question, inquire and 
investigate, examine and evaluate both the experiencer and the 
experience. So that one might know better who they are not.</span></p>

			<p><span>I have said elsewhere 
that the sorrows and the ills, that come and go in our lives and in the 
world. Can be traced back to our "separateness" from our "True 
Identity". It is our "incompleteness, our lack of "wholeness" that 
creates our fragmentary thinking. While at the same time, we live in and
 among a shared fragmentation that we have inherited out of our "race" 
consciousness, which we daily contribute too.</span></p>

			<p><span>We have, and we continue 
to create and promote this fragmentation. Leaving the "Creation Puzzle 
unsolved. As we join Plato's cave dwellers; in taking the " unreal' as "
 real". Causing us to build on sand.</span></p>

			<p><span>I guess at this point, we
 need to offer up another perspective about perception. That what is 
thought to be, is not. Although we say it is.</span></p>

			<p><span>If I were to ask you, "do
 you want something to drink"? And you said; "a cup of tea, please ". 
And I proceeded to make some tea and pour it into your cup. And you 
reply; "what nice tea cups you have". Do we have a definition problem, 
as to what an object may or may not be called?</span></p>

			<p><span>When is a teacup not a 
teacup but called a teacup? When we use the teacup as a coffee cup? Yes 
and no. For in reality, what we call a teacup is not a teacup. But we 
call it a teacup anyway. Why? Maybe, it is expedient, or a convenience. 
But, whatever the case, the teacup is made of porcelain. Therefore it is
 a porcelain cup. Right! Not necessarily so, it is a collection of 
hydrogen, oxygen, sand, clay, etc., etc, or could we go further and say:
 we are talking about atoms, molecules, protons, electrons and neutrons.
 An energy, possibly only light. The point of all this verbiage; what we
 think we see and define is fragmentary. Knowing and being aware of 
Reality is not that easy. How many things, on a daily basis, do we take 
at the face value, we have given them.? </span></p>

			<p><span>We call Christianity, 
Christianity; it is not "Christianity". But we call it Christianity 
{expediently} anyway. The same can be said about "Islam", "Judaism", or 
"Buddhism".</span></p>

			<p><span>We are back to "Who" we 
are. Or who we call ourselves. Whatever we say we are, we are not. We 
are not "this" or "that". This and that, are transient, changeable. Not 
permanent. The "Ultimate Self ", the "I" of the "I am" is ones', 
Absolute Nature. In the beginning it is easier to say that which I am 
not. I can say; I am not my mind, my thoughts, ideas, emotions, senses 
or feelings. Oh no! , I am much, much more. What is that much, much 
more? In the final analysis, only you can answer that. If you want too, 
you will seek out the answers. If you are persistent and committed to 
"knowing", who and what you are? The answers will come.</span></p>
