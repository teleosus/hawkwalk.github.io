                  #cc6600;">Answer:</span></strong></p>
            <p><span">There are many&nbsp;differences, reasons and
                nuances socially, economically and
                politically&nbsp;that&nbsp;affect&nbsp;the parenting and
                the education of the child. Making it unfair to compare,
                since we have so neatly divided the World into the
                developed and the undeveloped Countries. Then we have
                the differences within the educational systems in all
                Countries. You have the Private and the Governmental
                Schools who find themselves&nbsp;locked in a power
                struggle. The gap between the education in the rural
                areas and the urban sector.&nbsp;The liberal view and
                the conservatives position in regards to Curriculum </span"></p>
            <p><span">The Rich and the Poor&nbsp;with their reference
                points. And then we have&nbsp;those who are opposed to
                the standardization of testing or the annual competency
                evaluation of teachers and the list goes on. </span"></p>
            <p><span">How best to parent and educate a child needs to be
                listed as the number priority in the World.
                &nbsp;Although I am afraid this is asking too much of
                the leaders of the World in their present political
                "state of mind"; since most countries spend far more on
                Defense, than on Education. In America more is spent on
                <em>Dog food</em> than on Education which is hard to
                believe. Or, how about the MILLIONS lost to corruption.
              </span"></p>
            <p><span">It is apparent that all systems, methodologies,
                ways and means in parenting and in the education of a
                child should be continuously evaluated and updated as
                the World shrinks around us.. Knowledge is expanding and
                technology is racing towards the stars. We see an
                acceleration of growth and evolution in every sector of
                Human endeavor across the wide spectrum in all the
                Disciplines and in the Citadels of 'Higher Learning".
                Since this is verifiable, no country has the right to
                deny any child the best it can give in the nurturing
                of&nbsp;each child's' potentialities. </span"></p>
            <p><span">The education of the child should rank alongside
                the number <em>one</em> priority that is taking the
                lives of 40,000 children each and every month, not
                counting the adults.. <strong>The eradication of
                  hunger, disease&nbsp;and starvation in the world is
                  paramount.</strong> </span"></p>
            <p><span">Can you fathom the reasons of&nbsp;"why' this is
                so? Does this make any sense to you? </span"></p>
            <p><span">This is sheer insanity in our advanced age of
                Knowledge and Technology.. </span"></p>
            <p><span">How can this be? </span"></p>
            <p><span">The feeding of the body, the feeding of the mind,
                and the feeding of the spirit is where civilization
                needs to <em>stand up and be counted</em>, in providing
                the most conducive conditions for these three entities..
                If there is any task more worthy, any endeavor more
                sacred, any challenge more noble than the feeding and
                the nourishing of the body, mind and spirit? Will it
                please step forward and be recognized. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Allow at this point a side note. </span"></p>
            <p><span">How many times have we thought or said and even
                heard others voice the same sentiments; <span">how is
                  it that we educate and train ourselves and others to
                  be knowledgeable, skilled and competent in all "manner
                  of things". Yet, we are like children playing with our
                  toys when it comes to the '<em>Art of Marriage' </em>and

                  the needed wisdom and skills for parenting? Are we not
                  strange animals, indeed? We spend our time and
                  energies becoming competent in our various professions
                  and trades. So we might earn more money, gain status
                  or power. Believing in doing so that this will make us
                  happy and&nbsp;contented, whole and complete. Or
                  whatever it is that we are looking for. But in many
                  cases our knowledge and competence fails us when it
                  comes to our relationships with our loved ones</span"></span"></p>
            <p><span">The most glaring example, although there are
                hundreds of others is the trained <em>Psychiatrist</em>.
                Whose marriage is on the Rocks and his/her children are
                the terror of the neighborhood.. And <strong>yes</strong>,
                I am aware of the saying; that <em>"one is not a
                  prophet in his own country"</em>. </span"></p>
            <p><span">The cure of our problem is to devise and implement
                a more excellent system or systems that will benefit
                both child and family for today's' World and all the <span"><em>future</em>
                  Worlds of the young and the families yet to come.
                  Surely the answer is in the problem itself. How often
                  have we used the words; ignorance, fragmented and
                  simplistic thinking in the context of the woes of
                  education The probable cure for the ills of education
                  are rooted in the above triad.&nbsp;So, how do we
                  destroy ignorance, fragmentation and simplistic
                  thinking? </span"></span"></p>
            <p><span">With knowledge and understanding; as to how we
                acquire a better knowledge and understanding of
                ourselves, others, the world and the things, <em>Of the
                  world?</em> </span"></p>
            <p><span">By <strong>becoming and being</strong> a <em>disciple</em>,
                i.e.. {Learner}. How? The environment and the conditions
                must be conducive so the more excellent educational
                systems can be put in place throughout the planet.
                Surely out of six billion plus people, we can find, not
                only the best human resources, the monies, but the <strong>will</strong>
                to answer this challenge. </span"></p>
            <p><span">After 13 1/2 years, 50 plus countries and speaking
                to thousands of students, teachers and parents. I have
                observed in the majority of the developing countries, an
                inordinate passion for the memorization and the
                regurgitation of facts. With less concern and emphasis
                placed on the <em>How?</em> and <em>Whys</em> of a
                much larger overview&nbsp;about the <em>connectiveness</em>
                of <em><strong>all and everything</strong></em>. </span"></p>
            <p><span">The art of rational thinking is put on the <em>back
                  burner</em>, along with the teaching of self-reliance,
                confidence and self-worth. Rote learning at its best, is
                not the best way.&nbsp;The <em>parroting</em> of a
                bunch of words without knowing the <em>genesis</em> or
                understanding the essence is of little value. We are
                talking about quality not quantity.</span"></p>
            <p><span">This should be underlined until our pencils wear
                out. </span"></p>
            <p><span">If we think we are in a knowledge and
                technological revolution now. We haven't seen anything
                compared to what is ahead within the first half of this
                century. Let alone, the wonders of wonders in the second
                half. For we will see advancements that will stagger the
                imagination and out <em>"Star Trek</em> even <em>Star
                  Trek"</em> making the last thirty-years look as if we
                have been standing still. Which raises the question; <em>Will
                  we and our children and their children be ready to
                  cope and adjust to all the coming changes
                  and&nbsp;innovations?</em></span"></p>
