                Verdana,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>Answer:</b></span></p>
            <p><span">Before answering this question, let me give a
                little personal background to the subject. There
                are"ways", or "how to meditate" beyond numbering, as
                there are teachers. Sixty plus years ago, around the age
                of twelve, I used to rummage through the shelves of "Old
                Book Stores" searching for many unanswered questions.
                During those early formative years, I came across a
                Seven volume set of books entitled <i><b>The Teachings
                    Of The Masters From The Far East</b></i>, written by
                Baird Spaulding. That spoke about the value of
                "Meditation" and there were other books such as; <i><b>A
                    New Model Of The Universe </b></i>by Ouspensky, <b><i>At
                    The Feet Of The Master </i></b>by Kristramurti. <b>Cosmic
                  Consciousness </b>by Bucke. Most of the words from
                these books have faded with the years. But the "spirit"
                that I caught then has never left me nor will it. I
                believed then and I still do that Meditation is the key
                to open the Door; so one can pass through on their way
                back into the "Void", the Absolute Body of Love from
                where they started. This personal passage to the "beyond
                the beyond" for me, has always been accompanied with the
                words; "Be still and know". They have been my wake-up
                call down through the years. I know the value, the power
                and the sustainability of these words. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Simply put; Meditation is about entering the "Sea
                Of Silence", and "Be still and know". It is about
                "posturing" and "attitude", a"right-mindedness and yet
                it is none of these words. The same as it is not how
                one; sits or stands, the folding of ones' hands or
                touching ones' fingers together. Or in attaining a
                special breathing rhythm or staring at a "Mandela" or in
                the repeating of a "Mantra". Meditation is an
                experiential "Happening" that embraces many ways or no
                ways. One needs to inquire, investigate, seek, knock and
                ask. Meditation needs to become a"way of life". It can
                be done in absolute silence; standing, sitting, walking
                or running. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Where does one start? One starts with a passionate
                desire, a ceaseless commitment and a determination to
                know.. If one is in earnest, he or she will become a
                "learner" in the truest sense. Within the context of
                "self-knowledge", "self-understanding", "becoming"and
                "being. "Meditation" can be the catalyst. But once again
                a word of caution; no teacher, method or words
                {descriptive or otherwise} will take you to the " peak".
                You must enter the "Sea Of Silence"&nbsp;it is there
                that you will find what you need to know about yourself.
                What you need to die for? What you need to "incarnate",
                to embrace, to taste. to become and be your own "flesh
                and blood". </span"></p>
            <p><span">Are there external Teachers, "Yes"! But none can
                compare to your own "inner guide", the"Teacher"within.
                Such words as; Observer, Watcher and Witness have been
                &nbsp;used to define the inner essence, this "inner
                guide".</span"></p>
            <div><span">Out of Infinity comes these words of Wisdom;
                "Know Thyself" and the "Kingdom of God is within<span">".

                  If you can come to an understanding of these words and
                  never allow them to leave. You will walk the path
                  "less traveled". And you will see "what you are not",
                  which will lead you to "what you are".. For we are,
                  what we finally see. </span"></span"></div>
            <p><span">The following is a recent exercise in "Meditating"
              </span"></p>
            <p><span">On entry into the "Sea Of Silence", I never know
                what will come to the surface. But I do know when the
                "Offering" comes; it comes from the "Source of All and
                Everything". Also; I am aware that as long as my mind is
                limited by time and space, the "impressions" which
                surface during meditation are filtered and fragmented.
                Because the mind like the body is temporal and highly
                susceptible to the limitations which are inherent within
                the externals of the World. Also, I am aware that I am
                "in the World, but I am not of the World" in the final
                analysis.. This point of reference allows a "knowing and
                an understanding" that reaches beyond the subjective and
                the objective posturing. For as an "Observer", a
                "Witness', a "Watcher"&nbsp;I am neutral, not unlike the
                neutron that is neither a proton or an electron but
                rather a neutralizer. In this Neutralization, my
                consciousness is one with&nbsp;"All and Everything".
                Beyond the&nbsp;Beyond.&nbsp;</span"></p>
            <p><span">In the evolution, the growth process of an
                individual, the "Observer", the "Watcher neutralizes
                both the subjective and the objective point of
                view&nbsp;as it sees both at the same time. The Watcher
                is watching the Watcher&nbsp;watching. The Watcher is
                detached, favoring&nbsp;neither the subject/object,
                positive/negative&nbsp;<span">,<span">(yang or yin)
                    during Meditation</span"></span"></span"></p>
            <p><span">T<span">his moment&nbsp;is not limited by either
                  time or space. I instinctively and intuitively "know"
                  a "truth" has risen out of the depths of the "Sea Of
                  Silence". And my steps&nbsp;<span">towards the
                    "Source" {"All and Everything"} have lessened, as
                    has the distance. I also sense the gathering of the
                    "shadows" and silently I whisper; "Not yet, please
                    not yet". </span"></span"></span"></p>
            <p><span">Before writing about the exercise; allow me to
                answer the question; once again? "Who" and "What" is the
                " Self", {Absolute Self, Ultimate Self}. For many names
                have been given to this "Something" inside each and
                every one of us that looks from within to that which is
                outside. This "Something" inside looking out. When the
                awakening begins the "Self-remembering" journey for
                some. Is the remembering of the "Self" as it was
                intended, as it was in the Beginning, before the "Great
                Separation". The return of the self" to the "Self",which
                it was created or intended to be. This&nbsp;"Journey"
                back to end the "Separation". "The Separation" that
                causes the many "arrows and slings" of the World" and
                our own misfortunes. </span"></p>
            <p><span">"The Light", {the Impression, the Vibration} is
                your "Pole Star". </span"></p>
            <p><span">You need to know and understand that death is but
                a breath away. And that it is not your enemy but a
                friend. It is said: "To gain life, you need to die
                daily". Are you not in the midst of the "beat" between
                death and rebirth each day? And do you not eat all
                manner of recycled matter? That which is dead, whose
                life was cut short so you might be sustained. The "air"
                you breathe "in and exhale" is it new or has it been
                recycled? All the waste and the former forms of every
                living creature in the air, on land or in the sea are
                they not returned back to the earth and renewed, reborn
                into different "forms" and "shapes"? Or the vast "Food
                Chain" with matter absorbing matter in the&nbsp;
                "taking" and the "giving" of life. It is not to absurd
                to say: "we eat the dead,so we might live". All "forms
                and shapes" of life "above" and "below" are food for
                "something" or "someone". One should never forget that
                we are nourished and sustained by the "lesser of the
                less" and the "higher of the highest". By, the animate
                and the inanimate, the tangibles and the intangibles. In
                light of all this "coming and going","entering and
                exiting "one should not fret or fear their departure.
                For if you do not depart,you surely cannot arrive. </span"></p>
            <p><span">The seed must die, if it is to live again. </span"></p>
            <p><span">And this is true for the "Now" and beyond the
                "Now". Does not the "Phoenix" rise out of its' own
                ashes? If this was not so, nothing could be manifested
                and most of all, that of the "human species". There is a
                question in this discussion that needs to be asked? Does
                anything really die? Or is it merely
                "transformed',&nbsp;just reshaped? In a sense the
                "mulch", the compost of the World is but one very large
                "holding pattern", a waiting zone for a re-entry at a
                different level of materiality. So many think of death
                as an "exit of no return". That we live, we die and that
                is that! But is that all there is? On the other side of
                the coin, we have many who believe that death is not the
                final answer. That there is much more to life, than just
                existing and dying. </span"></p>
            <p><span">But again, we need, we&nbsp;must say that words
                create words, do not be mislead. Words are not the
                vessel by which we go "beyond the beyond". Our return to
                the "Absolute Reality" from "relative reality" is
                predicated on&nbsp;<b>the Will, our conscious decision
                  and effort to seek, knock and ask?</b> The path "less
                traveled" will appear and your return assured. As some
                say; "Don't knock it until you have tried it". Or "just
                do it', you might like it." </span"></p>
            <p><span">If you have decided on meditation and
                are&nbsp;committed to learn of it. I leave you with
                three words, the "impressions" about these&nbsp;three
                words will come to you later. They are; "contemplation,
                "concentration" and "meditation" while just "sitting",
                or "standing", or "walking", or "running" <b>"in</b> <b>Silence".</b>
                If you will inquire about, investigate the meaning of
                these words for you. Making them your own, you will find
                your answer. But remember when the fruit arrives, the
                blossom always falls away. </span"></p>
            <p><span">In ending, I will not put a period, only a comma
                because "Meditation" is an ongoing process that centers
                in the "Now. Neutralizing the past and the future as it
                brings together the Absolute, that is the "Essence" of
                all there is. And the "Relative"; the manifestations of
                all the phenomena of the World as they meet in the "Now"
                which is beyond time and space. It is at this point of
                intersection that the duality of the Relative and the
                Absolute is resolved. The permanent and the transient
                are neutralized. And the Void becomes aware to us, as we
                stand in the midst, "knowing" we are home at last., The
                pilgrimage is nearing the end, as the "far country"
                slowly fades from sight.&nbsp;I am&nbsp;"Homeward Bound"
