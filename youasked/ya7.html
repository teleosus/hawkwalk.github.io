              answer the second part first. What you have never had, you
              do not miss. This is in the same vain, as when I was asked
              by a University Students during a "Question and Answer
              Session", if I missed having a "home". And I replied; Out
              of thirty-five years of marriage, I lived in "houses" few
              were the times I would have called them "homes".. They
              were in the most part; an"adversarial" training barracks.
              <p>I have accepted and decided that I have <i>two</i>
                daughters.&nbsp;Yet, the "relative realty' is; I have <i>no</i>
                daughters. I have a <i>son</i> yet no son. And I have <i>seven
                  grandchildren</i> yet no grandchildren. Each has
                chosen, I hope on their own volition not to communicate
                which of course is their prerogative, their preference.?
                How do I feel about their choices? I would prefer it to
                be different, but so be it.</p>
              <p>Ironically, I am in a way like my children who have
                believed and still do; that they have a father, but no
                father. But where we differ lies in '<i>knowing</i> and
                <i>understanding'.</i> Why this dilemma&nbsp;is so?? I
                thought possibly as they grew into adulthood they could
                shed the <i>grave clothes</i> of the past. And learn
                that life is not black and white. There are many shades
                of gray in between the gaps of living. That things
                perceived, seen or heard are not necessarily, true
                reality.</p>
              <p>One does not need to be a professional therapist to
                understand that a divorced mother or father can&nbsp;<i>transfer</i>&nbsp;their

                attitudes, moods, bitterness and resentments&nbsp;to the
                young.&nbsp; This sort of programming can be intentional
                or involuntary by either parent after a separation or a
                divorce. If one cannot <i>let go</i> of past histories
                and allow a closure. The child or children become the
                inheritors&nbsp;of a woman's' scorn or a fathers' hatred
                as both attempt to&nbsp;destroy the character of each
                other. Affecting and infecting&nbsp;the emotional
                stability of the child's'&nbsp;adult life. These shadows
                of fragmented thinking can continue to live if someone
                is continually "breathing life" into them. The '<i>good
                  mom'</i> and the '<i>bad dad'</i> scenario or vice
                versa is an extension of an unresolved marital
                relationship.&nbsp; Has nothing to do with some overt
                act of a child or children. When either parent purposely
                programs or manipulates a child's' relationship against
                the other parent. The child's freedom becomes
                compromised and violated. The consequences of such an
                act on the part of the parent can affect how a child
                will relate to others in or out of marriage..</p>
              <p>All three of my&nbsp;children have reached adulthood
                but are still living with their mothers' "<i>ghosts of
                  yesteryear".</i> How sad!&nbsp;In a sense&nbsp;I said
                that I &nbsp;have no family. This is not completely
                true; I have a large&nbsp;extended family because of the
                "World Walk". I have become part of many families and
                they of me. I have many adopted nieces, nephews,
                grandsons and granddaughters. I have spoken to over a
                thousand educational institutions both private and
                governmental; from primary level&nbsp;to the University
                level. Met with students, teachers and parents. To many
                students I am "Uncle Hawk", to others I am an elder
                brother or a grandfather. But the most cherished name is
                a Friend. Recently in a dialogue group, a young lady
                referred to me as "<i>being comfortable"</i>. Someone
                asked what she meant? Her reply was: "you know, like a
                safe and secure presence". "Comfortable", an interesting
                expression which reminded me that I am entering the "<i>winter"</i>
                of my years.</p>
              <p>There are so many variables with strong subtle
                influences that affect the structuring, the
                stability&nbsp;and sustainability of a family. But there
                is one overriding factor, one unit that can create the
                needed environment to give the most conducive conditions
                for a family to co-exist in balance, harmony and peace.
                Here we are talking about the father or mother who can
                create or destroy this balance, harmony and peace. How?
                The how is simple; by being out of balance, harmony and
                peace in their own <b>Being.</b>&nbsp; Their lack of
                {self} knowledge and {self} understanding creates a
                non-conducive environment for each parent and their
                offspring.</p>
              <p>For a moment lets look at a few of these variables. The
                Scenario goes something like this; two people meet
                possibly out of a strong&nbsp;physical attraction or
                need. The "Chemistry" seems just right and the need is
                met. They fall in love and get married. The courting,
                the flirting, the coyness and innocence; the mystique,
                the newness, the rapid pulse, the anticipation and the
                fantasies start to fade. And the "Stars" return from
                their fallen state. Because reality {relative) comes in
                the front door unannounced and stands center stage. A
                new "Play" is about to begin and it is called "Life".
                The two actors in this sometimes "Comedy", sometimes
                "Tragedy"; may have y come from two different lifestyles
                or backgrounds. Raised by a different set of parents
                with possible different value systems or ideology.
                Possibly, each individuals' educational level differs.
                Or maybe there is an age and experience gap. Add to this
                the many different reasons people hold for getting
                married. And we have the making of a Love Story to be
                told or a Tragedy to unfold.</p>
              <p>As we know there are no guarantees in life but the odds
                for success can be increased if both individuals upon
                entering a relationship bring with them a reasonable
                knowledge and understanding of their own strengths and
                weaknesses, as well as a sense of balance, harmony and
                peace. It is this "triad" that allows each individual to
                reach their own potential and in turn help others in the
                family structure to reach their own potentiality. That
                which they have always been but simply have forgotten,
                their "Ultimate Nature".</p>
              <p>I know there is somebody who is reading this, who is
                just dying to ask: What has love got to do with all
                this? Well, love if you will consider the following
                definition. Has everything to do with a relationship,
                all relationships; man, woman, child, the animate or
                inanimate.?</p>

              <p>(a note)</p>
              <p>The "self" spoken about here, is not our "finite self"
                but rather our "Ultimate Self", our "Infinite Self", our
                "Absolute Self", the "Imago Deo"? Choose your preference
                of terminology.?</p>
              <p>I ask: "Would you give a damaged gift, an undesirable
                gift, a gift that is unworthy, one that carries the <i>seed</i>
                of deception, harm or injury"? I think not? If we are
                going to offer up ourselves, giving the "<i>gift of
                  self"</i> to another. We need to seek after the more
                excellent to give. Which entails our continual growth
                and evolution, so this can be a Reality..</p>
