                  Rogers who once said "Everybody talks about the
                  weather but no one does anything about it." Well there
                  is <em>something else</em>&nbsp;that fills many of
                  the conversations all over the world. That <em>something</em>
                  is called, the "Children of the World". </span"></span"></p>
            <p>In small meetings, in the chambers of World
              Organizations, on the stages of political debates, in the
              streets, or in our homes; we talk about the children, who
              are going to bed each night hungry. Or those who have been
              traumatized because of senseless Wars. Others, because of
              the loss of their parents, due to aids. Or the many
              Children and Families who take refuge in Refugee centers,
              where the conditions are sub-human. We talk about the
              eradication of illiteracy and raising the Standards of
              Education. About making sure that all children have an
              equal chance to Education. We talk about the insanity of
              the "child soldiers". And those who are exploited in
              "child labor", or sold into slavery and prostitution. And
              then of course we have all the abused children that are
              suffering daily.</p>
            <p>We give many speeches in glowing terms about the
              "Children of the World" and how they are the future of
              World. But like the weather, we talk about the children,
              and we talk, and talk, as a World Community. Question; are
              we really concerned, in doing what needs to be done with
              the problems that children have to face on a day-to-day, a
              &nbsp;second by second agenda?</p>
            <p>Before the&nbsp;answering of&nbsp;the three
              questions.&nbsp;It needs to be said, that all is not lost;
              for&nbsp;there are those who are aware and
              concerned&nbsp;for the welfare of the Worlds'
              Children.&nbsp; Both in the Educational Disciplines
              and&nbsp;those among the Non-Governmental Organizations.
              Although this is encouraging, this is not enough "hue and
              cry". The Peoples of the World need to take to the
              streets, the dirt roads, the pathways and shout it from
              the roof tops, throughout all the land; "We are weary of
              the words, the platitudes'&nbsp;the incessant meetings,
              the bickering and power struggles and the promises that
              are never kept".</p>
            <p>For those who are sincerely&nbsp;trying to make a
              difference against the many&nbsp;inequalities. The level
              of difficulty is daily increasing for&nbsp;the
              interested,&nbsp;to deal directly with the Educational
              deficiencies. Partially&nbsp;because running parallel, we
              must&nbsp;deal and solve the many unprecedented conditions
              of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">poverty,</span>
              food insecurity, inadequate health and sanitation
              safeguards, and political indifference. Not to mention the
              unparalleled havoc and problems created by those who are
              responsible for the suffering of children, in every corner
              of the planet.</p>
            <p>Then we have a boiling cauldron of religious and racial
              bigotry, power struggles and the rampart greed and
              corruption, all fueled by ignorance, the blight of all
              Civilizations. This and other factors are laying waste to
              one of the Worlds' most precious resources, the "Children
              of the World." Who are being denied their worth, their
              potential and their possibilities!</p>
            <p>No peoples, no government, or nation can claim any degree
              of civility, or that of being a "just society. Unless, the
              POWERS TO BE admits to their lethargy.&nbsp;
              And&nbsp;their insipid&nbsp;talking about the appalling
              problems concerning " the Child" which has existed far to
              long. AND GET OFF of THE DIME&nbsp;and do something
              constructive. The" Child's" plight has been&nbsp;on the
              Table to long and&nbsp;is increasing as we race, where?</p>
            <p>Into an avalanche of words, that falls on deaf ears. The
              rhetoric must be replaced with rapid action. Unless we
              want the pages of history to read; "The people of the time
              lacked the courage of conviction and failed to act in the
              best interests to protect and promote the health and
              welfare of the "Worlds " children, which they were
              entrusted with.</p>

            <p><span">The following answers to the three previously
                stated questions are treated separately but they are not
                to be understood as being separate. For they are part of
                the whole, for within the three answers, there is an
                inherent unity. This Unity is true about "all and
                everything". And this thought should caution us, in our
                tendency to categorize, classify and catalogue
                everything as though they were separate.</span"></p>
            <p>The last answer pertaining to the family is a personal
              aside with a few observations. I would point the reader to
              several other articles on the web site, i.e. {the "Macro
              Bio" and the other is called "The Question". Both are
              related to the last question asked.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere in my writings I have said that my regrets and
              misgivings are few but in those few times I would have
              preferred that things would have been different. But as we
              know, life is not always in accord with our wishes,
              desires or wants. And in many cases these are not always
              in&nbsp;our best interests. Or, they do not coincide with
              the path one needs to walk.</p>
            <p>In this self-examining exercise, I am aware that the
              mitigating circumstances of my childhood and adolescence
              had there effect on my thinking and life decisions of
              later years. Particularly true, as to my inter-personal
              relationships in marriage. And this effect became even
              stronger, when faced with an adversarial environment. This
              "living on the fringes of&nbsp;hell" that I saw, felt and
              heard in my formative years. Being a witness, as my mother
              buried herself in a dehumanizing situation. The fights and
              abusiveness that destroyed any semblance of a "home". All
              this took its' toll and created within me a resolve and a
              determination to never allow this scenario to be repeated
              in my life, nor in a child's' life, if I were to marry and
              have children.</p>
            <p>A marriage where two people are like trains passing in
              the night. And holding very little in common, while living
              in a pretense of love and fidelity, could hardly be
              called, or resemble a communion of unity.</p>
            <p>Out of thirty-five years of marriage to four different
              women, I am convinced that a good marriage; a right
              marriage is one of balance, harmony and peace. To many
              believe, this is not possible, but it is possible! If the
              two people involved in the relationship affirm that this
              is an individual possibility and attainable. The key to
              this becoming and being a reality, lies within the growth
              and evolution of each individual as they come to the
              self-realization of "who" and "what" they were created,
              intended to become and be.</p>
            <p>Out of this comes; "balance, harmony and peace". Two
              people living in a relationship cannot begin to understand
              each other, until they first learn to know and understand
              themselves. Out of this knowledge and understanding, one
              moves into becoming and being, all they were meant to Be.
              And should they be fortunate enough to be given the "gift"
              of a child or children in the above context. Their "Cup"
              will surely overflow, as will their child's', or
              children's' "Cup".</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">The answer to the
                  question:</span> as to the important essentials for
                parenting and the education of the child?</strong></p>
            <p>The raising and the teaching of a child. Where does one
              begin? What can be said that has not been said before? How
              do we nurture and best equip "our children" for the known
              challenges and the unknown, yet to come. There are many
              voices out there; factions, theories, power struggles with
              their "hidden agenda", experts and consultants. And yet;
              parents and educators still lack the needed wisdom to
              devise and implement, so all children of the world can
              reach their own highest potential and be that which they
              were created to be.</p>
            <p>From a pragmatic perspective, what might we say? Well,
              there is a lot one could say. For there are many theories
              and methodologies; battle lines are drawn. But as the
              waves are not the ocean, neither are; the ways, means or
              instruments the essence of parenting and teaching.</p>
            <p>Are the theories important? Are there certain basic
              skills and techniques to help in the learning process? Is
              there a need to understand the developmental stages of a
              child? Do we need to learn "how,"to learn and pass this
              on.</p>
            <p>A big "yes", to all the above.. How much knowledge does a
              parent or an educator need to bring out the best, the more
              excellent? Should excellence be the goal of parenting and
              teaching? Who is the final Elevator, on how well a parent,
              or parents and a teacher; teaches? And who sets the
              standards? Will we every come to a consensus as to "the
              way" a child should go? I hope not! But this does not mean
              that certain structural methodologies and basics should
              not be put in place,&nbsp;while at the same time, we must
              not become inflexible. "The cure must fit the disease."</p>
            <p>In our search, to do right by the child and his/her
              education. We must always keep in mind, there are
              exceptions, as we structure for the majority. We have the
              "gifted child", the less gifted, the impaired, those who
              have been traumatized and abused,; physically and
              mentally. What do we do for them?</p>
            <p>How can parenting and teaching nurture and guide a child,
              to that point where they want to learn to learn, making it
              a lifetime acquisition and quest?.</p>
            <p>Let us start with a simple affirmation that needs to be
              fully understood and remembered by both parent and
              teacher. But it should not&nbsp;stop here, everyone needs
              to search out its meaning and relevance.</p>

            <p>It is not so much what we say, as much, as how we say it.
              Somewhere along the way in our growth process, there needs
              to be an emphasis shift from speaking the "word" to
              putting those words we have gleaned as important into
              doing. Which reminds me of a quote;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><span">"Actions speak so loud, that it is difficult <br>
                    To hear what is being said"</span"></p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Right action is preceded by self-knowledge, becoming and
              being the "word". That word or words which we have decided
              to be necessary in reaching a posture of balance, harmony
              and peace. A "Oneness" with "all and everything".</p>
            <p>A definition becomes a definition, when "we" become the
              definitive definition of those words that we hold to be
              Self-evident and true. In these days of "hype", there is a
              need for a personal moratorium to be given; a&nbsp;due
              consideration, on the economy and&nbsp; clarification of
              the incessant babble of&nbsp;words that&nbsp;fills the
              air.</p>
            <p>A daily process of selection, of discrimination as to
              what words, thoughts or impressions, we will ingest, to
              become our own "flesh and blood".&nbsp;which is integral
              not only to the health of our own body, mind and spirit.
              But for the greater communities in which we move and share
              in. We should not allow anyone or anything externally to
              choose the words we wish to "incarnate. We are responsible
              to investigate, inquire, question, to seek and search out
              those "words" and "impressions." that will lead us out of
              the far country, back to our rightful heritage of "unity
              consciousness".</p>
            <p>It is not accidental that history has recorded the many
              diverse searchings of the human species, as to our origins
              and the meaning of the "gift of life". For within all the
              known religions, {primitive or the sophisticated}, myths,
              creeds, rituals and ecclesiastical murmurings, there has
              been three questions waiting in the wings to be addressed;
              "Who am I"? Why am I here "? And "Where am I going"?</p>
            <p>It is in the answering of these three quintessential
              questions, along with the process of selection and the
              infusion of those words that enhance and energize the
              search for completion, a"wholeness". I hold these things
              to be the beginning and the means to "becoming and being",
              all we were intended to be.</p>
            <p>This selection and "infusion" leads to a posturing, a
              subtle change in the materiality of the "mind, body and
              spirit". Some call it a "charisma", others an "aura", a
              presence or a "transfiguration". Here again, it is not the
              descriptive word that is important. It is that "something"
              one senses, feels or intuits. That "something" that
              emanates, fills the air, the space and the recipient. In
              that brief moment of "en-light-en-ment"; what was dark
              becomes light, what was false becomes truth, what was
              unreal becomes real. For lack of a better word, we sense a
              "presence", it fills the "Now". In that moment, to use a
              metaphor: truth becomes written on the heart".</p>
            <p>When the speaker of the "word" or "words, whether a
              parent, an educator, friend,, an associate, lover or
              spouse, becomes that which they speak. Then the fusion
              just "is". In that moment the "spirit is caught". In this
              "happening, we know, we know. We know because the speaker
              has become the "definitive definition" of the "word" which
              was spoken. He or she not only&nbsp;"walks the talk". But
              stands in the Light.</p>
            <p>How does this happen, this en-light-enment? Little is
              known or rather the words we have to explain this
              phenomenon are inadequate but many are the witnesses" to
              the fact". In most cases this event is a fleeting,
              momentary occurrence while at other times, for some, it is
              more frequent.. This en-light-enment or as some refer to
              as an "awakening" comes in the "blink of an eye" while for
              others the journey is arduous. It is suspected that the
              acquisition of "being in the light" is quickened if one is
              in earnest, wholly committed in "mind, body and spirit".
              Once the task is taken, there is no looking back. A
              passion and a resolve is needed if one is to stand "in the
              light". Or to express it differently, one needs to
              ceaselessly "knock, ask and seek". And en-light-enment
              will be given. The "way back" must be a conscious personal
              choice and a conscious effort.&nbsp;In this; no one can
              choose for another.</p>
            <p>Back to this "catching of the spirit". A good part of
              what we learn is "caught"; the habits and behavior, we
              have acquired. Our personalities; how we think, speak,
              move and approach life. Also our likes and dislikes, our
              wants and desires, along with our anxieties, doubts and
              fears. Whether we will admit it or not, we have been
              influenced consciously and unconsciously by others;
              parents, teachers, mentors, peers, friends, associates and
              "the rich and famous". Plus the fact, that we as
              individuals are great imitators, we copy and emulate
              manners, traits, habits and many other nuances. We do what
              is fashionable or the "norm" or in "keeping up with the
              Jones's". This mirroring begins in the cradle and follows
              us all through life. The young observe the old. The child
              watches the adult as to "how" they think, act and react.
              How "word" and "action" compliment or oppose each other.
              Once a child learns that an adult speaks with "forked
              tongue". The adults' words lose their import and vitality.
              Here there is a much deeper nuance involved. A parent, a
              teacher or a mentor without "soul" to borrow from the
              music industry, should not be surprised that, their words
              lack the power to inspire and enhance. The adage; "that
              one cannot give, what one does not have". Or if the well
              is dry one cannot give to the thirsty, is applicable here.</p>
            <p>The developing child is bombarded day in and day out, all
              the way into adulthood with a multiplicity of external
              images, words and impressions. Then there are those
              pressures from the parents, peers, teachers and other
              adult authorities that seem never ending. Within this
              context, an immature "human nature" seeks an easy way out.
              And asks; "who can I copy? Who can I emulate? I hope this
              does not appear to be to simplistic, because the nurturing
              and the education of a young mind is serious business. And
              must not be taken lightly. Adults who have children, have
              no greater or nobler task than the nourishing of the
              young. For the World and all future generations will be
              for the better or the worse. In the light, of how well we
              perform as "guiding lights" in the sacred tasks of&nbsp;
              parenting and the&nbsp;teaching of the young.</p>
            <p>Let me end with a personal note about the parenting I
              received. I will try not to repeat what I have written in
              the "Macro Bio" Except to mention that interspersed in the
              "nightmarish" events of my childhood there were certain
              values and lessons, which were given by my mother. That
              made a lasting impression; "I caught the spirit". I do not
              know where or how she received her wisdom, although she
              was an avid reader. Nor, do I fully understand after all
              these years. How the wisdom she possessed did not
              alleviate her many sufferings? But what I have learned in
              80 plus years is that appearances cannot always be
              construed as Reality. And that, which happens here in time
              and space is&nbsp; temporary, it is not forever. "We are
              in the world but not of it ". We are of "That" which "just
              is". "That" which has no beginning or end, for it is both.
              There is no duality.</p>
            <p>Discipline and consistency comprised the foundation of my
              mothers' parenting. I always knew where I stood. "No" was
              always "No", it wasn't "yes" the next second. If she
              promised something, she never broke her promise. If she
              said a certain time, it was that time. If she said she
              would, she did. You could count on it. Out of this
              approach I felt "secure" even in the midst of turmoil. She
              also taught levels of limit, I knew what was acceptable in
              her eyes. As I grew, she adjusted the limits. And I can
              still remember the words, when I would say: "but Billy's
              mother said "yes". Her reply; "I am not Billy's mother, I
              am your mother; who loves you. My responsibility is to
              teach you to be responsible in thought, word and deed. To
              choose the best, among the many alternatives". And, until
              I know or feel that you are responsible. My decisions are
              to be obeyed". "When you leave and go out on your own. You
              will have to decide, what is the best, the better and the
              more excellent for you, as each situation arises".</p>
            <p>Her belief in consistency overflowed into other areas of
              her life. She understood that personal habits were
              important. They could benefit or harm not only the person
              themselves but have a lasting effect on others. This
              became evident to me later on in life, as I remembered how
              she kept house and scheduled her day. She was not a
              perfectionist, but she was orderly. Meal times and bedtime
              were not haphazard. Breakfast was at seven, lunch at noon
              and dinner 6:30 in the evening, she never wavered. As I
              grew older and observed other children and their parents,
              as to how they lived and were taught or not taught. I
              understood my mother's discipline for me was out of love
              and concern. She was not doing it for herself; she was
              doing it for my benefit. It was also obvious that the
              habits and the affirmations, she had instilled were
              working proofs, as my confidence and small successes
              increased throughout my formative years.</p>
            <p>My interests were many and my mother encouraged all of
              them. It was her belief that a child should experience as
              many things as possible. And out of this process, learn to
              discriminate as to what is important and that which is not
              so important. Her methods were really very simple. She
              nourished the curiosity which I seemed to have had in an
              over-abundance. By encouraging me to always ask questions
              about anything and everything. I cannot remember her ever
              saying; "I am to busy ". She was interested in my learning
              the "connectiveness" of all things. Early on, I was taught
              to observe and ask "why"? And it felt "right" for me.</p>
            <p>I mentioned in the beginning, that my mother instilled
              certain affirmations within me. To be more precise, the
              substantive "essence" was within, as it had always been.
              She only seconded the motion. The affirmations and the
              power "awakened" the known and set the direction to start
              my journey back.</p>
            <p>Here are but a few of the injunctions, they were usually
              served up with my breakfast or sometimes in the evening.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span">+ Do not start something, unless you are going
                  to finish it.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ If you think something is impossible for you
                  to do. You will never know&nbsp;if it is impossible
                  unless you try it.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ Anything worth doing is worth doing well. But
                  do not stop doing.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ When you decide to learn something, learn to
                  do it well. Do it till you are better at it. When you
                  become better. Try to be the best you can be. And when
                  you are the best you can be. Remember you are just
                  beginning. Excellence is your goal.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ Do not despair in failure. Greet it as a
                  friend, a guide. For within failure are the seeds to
                  success?</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ There are times when the "good" is "bad" and
                  the "bad" is "good". The challenge is to know when
                  these times arrive. And what we will do with this
                  paradox.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ Early to bed and early to rise, makes one
                  healthy, wealthy and wise.</span"></p>
              <p><span">+ Always remember; whatever it is: a crisis, a
                  circumstance or a difficult situation. "This too shall
                  pass".</span"></p>
              <p><span">&nbsp;<span">The power of the word, never sell
                    it short. As important as the selection of the word
                    or words&nbsp;are. It is how one says the word, is
                    the word. Herein lies the POWER. It is the person
                    behind, in front and around the word or words. It is
                    in the way one looks, stands, sits, walks and
                    exemplifies a presence, a power. Or we could say, it
                    is ones' state of being. That can engender, energize
                    and give impact to the spoken word. </span"></span"></p>
