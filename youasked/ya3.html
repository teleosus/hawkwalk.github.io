                  The Australians use a term I have referred to many
                  times. They have coupled two terms; the words "walk"
                  and the word "about". And that is what I do, I do
                  "walk about", here there and everywhere. But yes,
                  there are times I use transportation.</span></span></p>
            <p><span><span>Here I am reminded of the story of a Sufi
                  Master who while traveling came to a wide river he
                  wished to cross. Below the path he was traveling was a
                  raft tied to a rope anchored on the other side of the
                  riverbank. As he approached the ferry, the "ferry
                  tender" recognized him as a Sufi Master. When the
                  Master asked how much the fare was to cross to the
                  other side. The ferry tender asked; "Why are you
                  taking the raft, when it is known that you can walk on
                  water? The Sufi Master replied; "It is foolish to walk
                  on the water when there is a way to rest and save the
                  "gift" for something far greater".</span></span></p>
            <p><span><span>When it comes to crossing large bodies of
                  water this pilgrim has no hesitation in using a plane,
                  ship, ferry, raft or a dugout. In the last thirteen an
                  a half years of walking America, I was&nbsp;in a
                  plane, nine times. Three of those times were during
                  the 50 state "walk" through America. I flew to
                  Skagway, Alaska from British Columbia. Then after
                  doing the Yukon {The Chilcoot Trail to Dawson}. I
                  entered back into Alaska after a "walkabout" around
                  Alaska, I walked down into the States via the "Alaskan
                  Highway". My entry point was Maine. After reaching the
                  West Coast I flew to Hawaii the Fiftieth State and
                  eventually returned by plane. Completing the three an
                  a half year walk of all 50 States.</span></span></p>
            <p><span><b>"To start the World Walk"</b></span></p>
            <p>I flew from California to Dublin, Ireland to march in the
              St Patricks' Day Parade. From Ireland into Scotland, into
              England, into Belgium. I didn't get back into an airplane
              again until I reached Zimbabwe in 1992 ; from there I flew
              into Bombay, India,(sorry, Mumbai). From India I walked
              into Nepal. After trying for a couple of months to get
              permission from the "Republic Of China" to walk into
              Tibet. It was a no-go. They would not allow me to walk
              across the Border. So I flew to Hongkong walked from
              HongKong to Chengdu. From there I tried to get permission
              to walk the Tibetan Highway into Tibet. Again the
              Authorities refused. I continued on through Asia. Upon
              reaching Bali; I flew from Bali to New Zealand, from New
              Zealand to Argentina. Since then no Planes</p>
            <p><span>Sometimes while speaking to groups someone will
                asked; "do I walk up and down the aisle of the plane"?
                My reply; "no, I run in place". This journey and my
                choice to "walk" brings forth some strange responses.
                "Why don't you get a horse"? Or ride a bicycle or take a
                plane, train, bus or motorcycle? Why walk? Someone once
                said; probably Thoreau; "walking is unparalleled
                freedom". When one walks in, through and beyond time and
                space they become during that moment, "part of" and it
                becomes "part of" them. It is this "in"and "of" that
                gives content to our "now's". Increasing our awareness
                levels of the moment.</span></p>
            <p><span>I have established in my mind certain criteria
                about this walk. Such as upon entering a village, town
                or a small city, I walk the area. If the city is larger
                {million or more}, I walk the places of interest. But
                once I have walked an area, I do not walk it again.
                Should I choose to return to that specific area, I will
                in most cases seek transportation. It makes no sense to
                walk over the same terrain twice, unless I want the
                exercise. I have stated elsewhere that I feel I have a
                need to walk at least ten miles each day to stay in
                shape while I am in a city. Sometimes I choose hills to
                climb or many steps. This is a survival precaution.
                Someone has said; that if one would walk ten miles
                everyday for seven years. They will have circled this
                spinning Earth. So all&nbsp;the milkmen and
                ladies&nbsp;have probably walked enough to
                have&nbsp;circled the World.</span></p>
            <p><span>I make it a point if I am going to speak before a
                group that I walk to the place of the meeting&nbsp;if
                I&nbsp;know how to get there. For invariably during the
                Question and Answer period some one will ask; " how did
                you arrive here"?</span></p>
            <p><span>Within the options of the criteria I have set for
                this " walk". Should I become ill while walking I will
                take transportation to the nearest town or city. But
                should the nearest town or city not have the needed
                facility for my illness or accident. I will choose
                appropriately. Should the authorities for whatever
                reason refuse me to walk across the border or a bridge
                or to walk through a tunnel, or some other&nbsp;specific
                area. I will rely on transportation to solve the
                problem. If there are no Shoulders on each side of the
                Highway, I will take transportation to where there are
                shoulders,</span></p>
            <p><span>If there is Civil strife in the area or a war
                breaks out while I am walking in the area. I will take
                the quickest way out.The same holds true when natural
                calamities take place; floods, typhoons, swollen rivers,
                snowstorms or an outbreak of disease.To do otherwise is
                to deny commonsense I am always conscious of the fact
                that the "Walk Of The Hawk" is about walking around the
                world not riding around the world. When this trek is
                finished in the next ten years or so, I have no doubt
                that the walking mileage of this "World Walk" will
                reflect a record as to the years spent and the distance
                covered as related to my age.</span></p>
            <p><span>But this trip is not about records or answering the
                critics along the way who insist, this is not a "pure
                walk". I truly believe that many of the sarcastic and
                cynical remarks stem from a "hostile envy". To those who
                are critical I invite them to walk in my steps, travel
                the countries I have traveled and will travel in and out
                of.&nbsp;Carry the backpack that I carry and walk the
                miles I walk. Face the daily challenges of the unknown
                and the unexpected. Then and then only write their
                conclusions.</span></p>
            <p><span>I remember after walking the fifty states there
                were the detractors, the doubters and those who were
                indifferent. But as always those who rain on other
                peoples' parades have always been around. I have little
                interest in their reasons of dissatisfaction. Doers do,
                complainers complain.</span></p>
            <p><span>I hope I will not be the last to experience this
                privilege of "walking around the World". Others should
                consider the challenge and receive the merits and gifts,
                the challenge it&nbsp;offers. It is important that we
                extend the "edges of the envelope" an attempt to go
                beyond our self-imposed limitations so that we might
                realize our fullest potentialities and possibilities. No
                one should destine himself or herself to a life of
                mediocrity. Life is to be experienced to the fullest if
                we only allow ourselves to live in the "no risk zones'
                the "comfort zones". We are cheating ourselves and
                forsaking our "gifts". Mediocrity should not be
                acceptable to us. No more than we should accept that we
                are less than we are.</span></p>
            <p><span>We only walk this way once. And we should make it
                worthwhile.</span></p>
