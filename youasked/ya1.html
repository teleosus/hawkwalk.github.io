            <p><span color="#cc6600" style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p>The above question has surfaced during interviews for
              newsprint, radio, television and in informal conversations</p>
            <p>Are there any differences? What if anything sets us
              apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before speaking about our differences.
              Let us examine some of our similarities. One can observe
              in kind, the way people interact within their family
              structures; husband to wife, wife to husband, parents to
              children, siblings with siblings, the inter-rivalry along
              with the "pecking order" of an inter-generational family.
              The same nuances are all there. Of course these are
              interspersed with cultural idiosyncrasies. Then we have a
              likeness in some of the same facial and physical gestures
              as we speak Then there is a mirroring of our behavioral
              shortcomings and proclivities. Along with the sameness in
              many of our needs, desires, wants. dreams and "yes" even
              our fears.&nbsp;Also, in&nbsp;the way we anticipate along
              with our expectations. Probably one of the most telling
              signs of our commonality is in our look alike anxieties,
              doubts, and&nbsp;fears.</p>
            <p><span">We have the same curiosity; asking the same
                eternal questions: "who Am I? Why Am I here? And where
                am I going? We share in the same gift of "consciousness"
                Which allows us to have the ability to "think". Here, we
                need to underline "being able to think"&nbsp; Many
                forsake this gift and opt out not to think or to think
                sparingly. What passes for thinking gives birth to
                fancies, whims, opinions, parroting, half-truths and
                "fuzzy logic". Which leads us into a minefield of
                "simple-mindedness". Simplistic thinking betrays;"I
                think therefore I am". It denies the very essence of
                consciousness, which is "awareness". Being aware,
                singularly aware as to who and what we are. <span">Betraying

                  our heritage and our&nbsp;gifts. It is within this
                  type of fragmented thinking we find the seeds of our
                  separateness, pain and suffering.</span"></span"></p>
            <p><span>In this multi-dimensional World in which we share,
                there is a great need to become more
                conscious,&nbsp;more aware. Aware that we are the World
                in the truest sense. Or to rephrase; since we are not of
                the World rather&nbsp;the World is in us. As is the
                Universe and the Cosmos. It is truly <strong>"all for
                  one and one</strong> <strong>for all</strong><strong>.</strong>
                Now if we would live as if this is true for us. That we
                are indeed "aware" that all is within us. We will
                instinctively love "all and everything", as we love
                ourselves. As the saying goes: "love others as you love
                yourself". Of course this is&nbsp;easier said than done.
                One of the greatest obstacles to this 'loving of others
                as one loves themselves'. Is that we have not yet
                learned how to love ourselves or in some cases even like
                ourselves.</span></p>
            <p><span>Why is this so?</span></p>
            <p><span>We do not know, who we are? We do not realize the
                truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;That we are lovable and likeable. Were
                we not lovable and likeable at birth? Is not our " True
                Nature" that of Love. If we are other than that,
                &nbsp;we have been programmed&nbsp;not to be of this "
                Absolute Love". We are IT, of IT and in
                IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange as it seems we do not know
                that we are out of love. We see ourselves as other than.
                We have forgotten our identify, we do not remember who
                we really are?. We join a growing multitude of humankind
                asking; "what's life all about"? "Why am I here"? "And
                where am I going"?</span></p>
            <p><span>This was and is a big wide wonderful world! Before
                we as a species came along and turned it upside down.
                The World was doing just fine. What happened? Simple and
                I would underline the word simple. <strong>"Here a
                  child am I, holding up both my hands. One is, "who I
                  am not". And the other is "who I am".&nbsp;The problem
                  you see is the {I, me and mine} which
                  lies&nbsp;in-between my hands.</strong></span></p>
            <p><span>This false identity needs to be reversed so that
                our true identity comes " front and center." It is in
                the process of our self-knowing and our
                self-understanding as to "who we are not" that we will
                become aware of "who we are". In turn, as a race, as a
                species we will become aware&nbsp;that we are all one
                and the same. That beneath and beyond our diversity we
                are of the same seed, the same substance which is of the
                ABSOLUTE LOVE; the ABSOLUTE VOID. Out of which, all
                things are manifested. Manifested in balance, harmony
                and peace.</span></p>
            <p><span>Within the verbiage of all religions this ABSOLUTE
                TRUTH is interwoven. It is said, has been said and will
                be said in a thousand different ways until that day when
                each will know,&nbsp;understand and be the spoken
                "word".&nbsp;It will be written in the minds and hearts
                of all"&nbsp; All will know that the word, whether that
                word be spelled; "Truth","Love","Light" or "Rightness"
                needs to become our own flesh and blood.&nbsp; Otherwise
                it is but&nbsp;idle&nbsp;chatter. This "incarnation",
                this&nbsp;fusion,&nbsp;must be a "NOW" EXPERIENCE. Out
                of this comes the definitive definition of "who" and
                "what' we are.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;we will stop mistaking the
                blossom for the fruit. No creed, ritual, image, symbol,
                intonation or exhortation: no edifice, structure,
                methodology, theology, ecclesiastical polity or
                religious rhetoric will suffice. All human intentions of
                piety will cease. All will know that they know. Harmony,
                balance and peace will prevail. All wondering and
                wandering will cease as will the questions. The
                prodigals will have returned consciously back to the
                "ABSOLUTE VOID, REMEMBERING "WHO and "WHAT" they were
                and always have been.&nbsp;Out of the&nbsp;Beyond of
                the&nbsp;Beyond. </span></p>
            <p><span>The second question was; "Are there any differences
                that sets us apart from one another'? The list is long
                and we know most of them; language, culture, religion,
                and politics. These four are the "Great Separators".
                Along with literacy or illiteracy, freedom or bondage,
                economic security or economic uncertainty, a closed or
                an open society. All these divide and widen the gulf
                that exists between all the "peoples of the World". But
                the most glaring factor that causes "separateness" on a
                grand scale is our fragmentary thinking, across the
                entire spectrum of our relationships. Whether they be of
                a personal nature or a one to one response with others
                in a family structure or a business arrangement, social
                or non-social. Wherever this fragmentary thinking might
                exist, "separateness" will be found. Along with it, one
                will find, suffering and pain.</span></p>
            <span>I am often asked; "how does&nbsp;one know what is
              right and what is wrong?" If we are responsible for
              creating the conditions that causes or allow the pain and
              suffering of others that is wrong. If we help in the
              alleviation of pain and suffering then this is right </span>
            <p><span>Our problem lies in our self-identification with
                the externals of life We talk about our identity as
                being "this or that". I am "Polish" or "Jewish" or an
                "American", "Christian or "Islamic", "Black" or "White".
                I am a "conservative" or "liberal". I am a doctor,
                lawyer, Indian chief, candlestick maker or whatever. Our
                IDENTITY lies within not without. We are not "this" or
                "that". "This" and that" are transitory. When and
                where,we find our Ultimate Nature there will be no
                "separateness" only a <strong>"Unity-consciousness"</strong>.
                A balance between the inner and the outer. There will be
                no inner and outer for they will be as One for they are
                one. All manifestations and the yet to be manifested are
                out of the same <strong>WILL</strong>, the same<strong>
                  LOVE</strong>, the same <strong>TRUTH</strong>, the
                same <strong>FORCE</strong>, the same <strong>ABSOLUTE</strong>,
                the same <strong>VOID.</strong></span></p>
