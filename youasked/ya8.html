            <p><span">The e-mail questions about my sojourn have been
                many; ranging from the physical aspects of the trip to
                equipment, to handling the different languages, to
                possible Visa problems, safety, security and finances. <span">In
                  speaking to groups; students and faculties, business
                  or <span">civic groups; one of the questions often
                    asked; "How long did you prepare for your "Walk
                    around the World"? And a related inquiry as to my
                    choice of specific routes and destination, before
                    embarking on my odyssey? </span"></span"></span"></p>
            <div><span">&nbsp;</span"></div>
            <div><span">In a sense my preparation started formulating at
                seven years of age with a dream of someday "walking
                around the World". And the holding on of that dream
                along with the accompanying desire, up until the day
                that&nbsp;I left for the 'Open Road'. </span"></div>
            <div><span"></span"></div>
            <div><span">Before leaving for "The Walk" I vowed to keep
                the journey as flexible and as unencumbered from details
                as possible. Since walking in its' purest form is
                'unparalleled freedom' it is of paramount importance to
                protect this freedom if at all possible. Of course as
                the time came for the dream to become a reality a
                certain amount of preparation became essential. </span"></div>
            <div><span">&nbsp;</span"></div>
            <div><span">About three months prior to my departure date, I
                began to prepare and implement a plan of action. As
                usual when faced with an unknown or a lack of facts
                about something I am interested in. A little research
                became appropriate. So I begin visiting all the "Outdoor
                and Camping" Stores in the Dallas and Fort Worth area;
                asking questions,collecting equipment brochures and
                catalogues. Soon I began to understand the language and
                the terminology of the "Camping world". </span"></div>
            <p><span"><b>Allow me to make a (side note)</b> <br>
              </span"></p>
            <p><span">Whatever interest or endeavor one might choose to
                participate in; it is vital for one to learn the
                language; the terminology and the different nuances that
                are particularly related to the field of ones' choice.
                While at the same time, always remembering that
                knowledge needs to be supplemented by the experiencing
                of said choice. For in essence we do not really know
                until we have become part of that&nbsp;which we are
                interested in. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Well back to the "Camping World", after due
                consideration I finally chose a "Kelty" backpack with an
                external frame. The pack design would allow me to carry
                a hundred pounds, if I chose to do so. My second
                purchase was a pair of ankle top "Scarpa" hiking boots.
                After the purchase of the two above basic essential
                pieces of equipment. I started my training for the
                eventful day when I would begin "The Walk". D-day was to
                be August 28, 1983, on&nbsp;my 56th. birthday. Each day
                for a week I walked ten miles with thirty pounds {bags
                of sugar and flour} in the backpack. Increasing the
                distance and the weight each week for two months. By the
                end of the two month period the daily walking distance
                had become 25 miles a day, carrying 100 lbs. After which
                I reduced the distance to 20 miles per day and the
                carrying weight to 90 lbs. During that interval I
                purchased all the needed equipment and camped out for
                seven days and seven nights. Taking the tent down every
                morning after cooking breakfast and putting it back up
                each night. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Let's talk about the physical side of the journey.
                One needs to be in reasonable physical "shape" before
                undertaking a long "walkabout" as they do say in
                Australia. Also ones' mind-set must be flexible and
                adaptable to any and all conditions that might arrive
                along the way. Here it is important to learn; "to expect
                the unexpected". On any long extended walking trek the
                terrain and the climate will dictate to some extent the
                need to stay in shape. At the same time&nbsp;one
                needs&nbsp;to maintain a&nbsp;sensible diet, exercise
                and proper sleep. One should not assume that in just
                carrying a backpack and walking each day.That this wile
                be&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;enough to keep the body in "top
                form". There is a vast difference between walking in and
                through developed Countries as opposed to walking in the
                less developed areas of the World. Add to this, the
                walking in and through all the different seasons of the
                year with the variable climatic change. Plus&nbsp;the
                "now and then" natural calamities that can come without
                warning. Testing ones' stamina and endurance level.
                Therefore it is&nbsp;very important that one stays in
                "good health" and in optimum physical condition.&nbsp;</span"></p>
            <p><span">Walking each day with or without the backpack for
                at least five miles after one has reached a city or a
                rest period is vital. Along with a daily routine of
                stretching and flexibility exercises. Followed by adding
                some"stomach crunches" at least eighty with
                a&nbsp;couple of sets of push-ups at various times
                during the day. And should one find they are staying
                "put" for three days or more. It wouldn't be a bad idea
                to do some swimming or play some tennis or basketball.
                Or find a "Health Club" and push around some "iron".
                Maintaining a healthy body, mind and spirit will pay
                dividends down the road. I can only suggest for&nbsp;all
                who read these words to give attention to the "care and
                maintenance" of their body, mind and spirit so their
                state of health will never hinder or impede their
                aspirations and dreams. </span"></p>
            <p><span">I have spoken elsewhere on the Website about
                finances and this journey. The monies needed; will
                depend upon ones' choice of transportation, type of
                accommodations, food and entertainment, repairs and
                replacement of equipment plus the miscellaneous expenses
                that occur from time to time. If you don't fly
                everywhere, or take a bus or a train. If you can live in
                a tent and cook your own food. And walk a set number of
                miles each day. You can see the world on $500.00 per.
                month, in the States or in the European Countries. In
                the less developed Countries you can live on much less.
                In relation to finances. I would suggest that one camps
                in a village or a small town just outside the larger
                cities if at all possible. Because everything is much
                cheaper than in the larger cities.. If one wants to do
                some sightseeing in the Metropolitan Cities. It is less
                expensive to travel in and out of instead of living in
                them. Of course if one is fortunate enough to meet
                someone who offers lodging or allows one to set up their
                tent on their property. "How sweet it is!" </span"></p>
            <p><span">Across the World I have met thousands mostly the
                younger travelers that work for a little while and save
                up enough money so they can visit the next Country on
                their itinerary. Of course this involves a risk of not
                finding work before the money runs out. One of the
                things that helps me to accomplish my journey on a small
                budget; I have no excesses or the need of outside
                stimulants. Over the years&nbsp;on this trek I have met
                to many people who have little or no control over their
                obsessive appetites and habits which in most cases costs
                money to maintain. </span"></p>
            <p><span">Another related question about the journey; is
                where do I camp? Of course the best place are those
                designated areas for campers with all the amenities;
                showers, laundry facilities, a small food store to buy
                some basic food supplies, etc., etc.,. But the&nbsp;most
                important; a good security system so you don't have to
                worry about your equipment. The latest camping site that
                fulfilled the above amenities plus a beach and Tennis
                Courts was just outside Macau on a small Peninsula
                called "Hac Sac". If you cannot find a protected area
                for your campsite be a light sleeper. While in Africa, I
                stayed in "Malawi" at a campsite and during the night
                several tents were robbed while the campers slept. The
                thieves used a razor blade to slit the tent&nbsp;and
                steal the equipment. A good rule to follow; is never
                leave your tent up and leave for the day unless you are
                sure that it is secure. </span"></p>
            <p><span">I have camped and slept on top of roofs,
                mountains, by streams, rivers and seas, forest and
                jungles, ravines and valleys. Also, I have stayed in
                Churches, Cathedrals, Schools, and Universities and on
                private property when there have been no campsites
                available in the Cities. There have been times when the
                Police allowed me to sleep in an empty cell when I
                arrived late at night in a town. But the number one
                priority, at all times in to feel secure in the place
                you choose to set up camp. Your equipment must be
                protected. </span"></p>
            <p><span">If you can prepare to enter a city or a town
                fairly early in the morning and find a safe place to
                leave your backpack. Possibly in a&nbsp;a locker or a
                luggage room or maybe with a friendly Storekeeper or
                a&nbsp;Restaurant owner. You can then scout around,
                asking&nbsp;about possible places&nbsp;in the city for
                camping. Let people know what you are doing
                and&nbsp;your needs. And probably before the day is out
                you will have found a safe place to put up your tent or
                someone has offered you a place to sleep. Be on the look
                out for fellow travelers and ask some questions. And
                don't forget to always be aware of what is going on
                around you.&nbsp;</span"></p>
            <p><span">Should<span">&nbsp;you find yourself in a very
                  remote area in the middle of nowhere and evening is
                  approaching, look for a good spot that will hide your
                  tent. And if this is not available, then do a little
                  camouflaging with some leaves and branches. So your
                  tent cannot be easily spotted from the road. Don't
                  light a fire or use a flashlight. One of the
                  exceptions to this; is of course if you are in the
                  Jungle where you know there are wild animals, light a
                  fire a fairly large one and make as little noise as
                  possible. Should an animal be curious enough to invade
                  the campsite, <b>make no sudden movement. </b>What
                  ever you have to do, do it slowly and deliberately. I
                  have found four things to be effective deterrents when
                  an attack seems inevitable; a fire, a bullwhip,
                  excessive noise {beating pans together,&nbsp;a loud
                  radio and firecrackers. Firecrackers are the quickest
                  and the most effective. In most encounters just be
                  still, just stand perfectly still. And while you are
                  standing there; ask yourself; "what will you do if the
                  animal decides to attack?" </span"></span"></p>
            <p><span">While I was walking Africa and camping; my large
                "Bowie knife" was always on my belt, plus my steel
                tipped Staff and two large custom-made Machetes were
                always handy. In speaking to groups;&nbsp;always without
                fail, someone would&nbsp; ask about being attacked
                by&nbsp;animals both the four-legged and the two-legged
                ones? I usually ended up by saying; " I promise not to
                bite the animals, if they promised not to bite me". As
                for the two-legged adversaries, I do whatever is
                necessary to protect "life and limb.". Most of our fears
                are unfounded. But this does not mean we become
                "pollyannaish" as I have said "we must be alert and
                aware". Much can be avoided if we just use a little
                common sense. Was it F.D.R. who said; "the only fear we
                have to fear, is fear itself". </span"></p>
            <p><span"><b>My equipment and supplies:</b> <br>

            <p><span">I hope this answers some of the e-mail questions
                about the journey, equipment, etc., etc. Should one
                decide to 'Backpack the World', I would suggest they
                have an overriding passionate desire to do so; along
                with an ample supply of discipline and determination.
                And from that first step never look back. And know in
                your mind, body and spirit that you can and will finish
                the "Quest". </span"></p>
