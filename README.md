I recently met Hawk Mc Ginnis, he's still going strong at 96, and he was distraught over having lost his domain name. He also thought he had lost all of his webpages. I managed to extract each 
individual page of it from the Internet Archive's Wayback website. I have spent  alot of time converting the links and repairing the screwed up formatting so it will run as a distinct website. 
It was written in HTML4 with very little CSS, no external. I am rewriting it as HTML5 with CSS but it seems to be at least usable for now. It's an ongoing project.
