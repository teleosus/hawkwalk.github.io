              the stroke of one second past midnight, a new millennium
              begins. A new day dawns for all of mankind. I wonder if
              this new era will mark the beginnings of a "New Brave
              World" not as "Aldous Huxley" described it. But a" New
              World" with new beginnings, new paradigms, new dimensions,
              new horizons, dreams and visions. A new way of "seeing",
              the World, the peoples of the World and the things in and
              of the World. A new way of being and doing, as individuals
              living out their lives in balance, harmony and peace with
              "all and everything. Is it a possibility that there will
              be a new man and a new woman in this coming millennium?
              Who will become and be that "Ultimate Nature" which they
              have always been but have forgotten. <br>
              <br>
              "A "person" for all seasons". Gentle, but strong in intent
              and resolve. Decisive , in action. <br>
              A defender of both injustice and inequalities. Quiet, but
              persuasive of voice and of "presence". Capable of
              commanding the needed power and energy to intervene and
              correct the negative imbalances. In whatever form they may
              take. Irrespective of personal risk. <br>
              <br>
              Is this possible; Yes!,&nbsp;because of the "courage to
              be" a courage that comes at that point of interdiction
              with the actuality of the moment. With this courage, comes
              a certainty and a strength that has grown in the midst of
              the Worlds' challenges.&nbsp;Tempered in the fires of
              trial and error, failure and defeat. This self-certainty
              and self-sufficiency allows an inner dignity. Giving
              a&nbsp;Presence, of being in balance,&nbsp;harmony and
              peace. A Presence that is sustained by; understanding,
              love and compassion.&nbsp;Which can and will an
              environment of peace and tranquillity if allowed too. <br>
              <br>
              This prota-type&nbsp;persons we are speaking about
              is&nbsp;aware and mindful of themselves, others, the
              World and the things of the world. As they move through
              life on a day by day basis. They have a cock-eyed
              optimistic view of life in general. This in no way, means
              that they are pollyannaish for they belong to the "why"
              people. Always asking, probing, investigating and
              inquiring about "all and every thing". Taking nothing for
              granted. <br>
              <br>
              Gathering, synthesizing and assimilating all manner of
              information that might be applicable for their future
              reference and use, as the need arises. They are the
              perennial pupils, "disciples " in the truest sense from
              the 'cradle to the grave'. Everything is important from
              the minutiae to the galaxy. To, these "all and ever thing"
              is connected, "all" is family. They hold that there is
              unity in the Worlds' diversities and beyond <br>
              <br>
              Out of this "connective-ness" comes a knowing, an
              awareness, an understanding of where others stand in their
              growth and evolution. This awareness and in-sight is
              somewhat disconcerting to others, at times. Which gives
              way to charges of being patronizing, condescending,
              superior or arrogant. But words such
              as;&nbsp;knowledgeable, self-sufficient and a certainty
              would better portray this awareness and
              in-sight.&nbsp;None of the above charges are justified.
              In some cases; there is&nbsp;a transference taking place
              to relieve the inner conflicts that are waging a 'civil
              war' within the person, who is making the charges. <br>
              <br>
              This "Millennium Person" we are inquiring about, will
              admit to faults but will not carry them around. Regrets
              are few, but no guilt is harbored, the self is forgiven,
              life moves on.&nbsp;There is a sharing in the sorrows and
              burdens of others but only to the point,&nbsp;there is a
              meaningful and constructive solution. To relieve the
              suffering. To carry someone else's load denies that
              person, the opportunity to grow and evolve into their
              potentialities and possibilities. Self-reliance and
              self-sufficiency cannot develop if one is
              co-dependent.&nbsp; True help is when the person being
              help, is help to that point where they no longer need
              help.&nbsp; Self-sufficiency is the criteria not
              co-dependency. <br>
              <br>
              He/she stands up for ideas, ideals and values. Allows
              others the right to their opinions though in disagreement.
              His or her perception sees the wider context of things,
              consequences for the past and the future. Allowing neither
              the past nor the future to dictate or be the final
              arbitrator in their lives. For they are confident that the
              right insights are to be found within, at the right time.
              <br>
              <br>
              Here one is a&nbsp;pathfinder, who remains true to
              oneself. Finds and pursues a life goal, despite the odds
              or any adverse circumstances. Open to the "now " and new,
              aware of the law of change and its' consequences. Immune
              to outside influences and open to the inner whisperings
              and inspirations which come out of the "sea of silence".
              Possesses powers of discrimination and determination.
              Maintains inner balance and harmony "come hell or high
              water". Versatile in thought and action. Able to interpret
              more and more potentiality. Decides quickly, decisively
              and correctly. Procrastination denies life and becomes
              part of a slow dying. Their "presence" is a soothing for
              some and an irritant to others. Especially for those who
              have a hostile envy. In most cases this Promethean
              proto-type challenges and energizes the moment. <br>
              <br>
              These proto-types possess of an inner vitality,are clear-
              headed and internally strong. Able to adapt the nervous
              system to change. Also able to bounce back, to make a
              quick recovery both mentally and physically. And to
              radiate a positive nature and courage in seemingly
              difficult and trying times. Standing firm and rising above
              life's vicissitudes, when needed. Cheerful and stable
              whether it be cloudy or sunny. <br>
              <br>
              They follow an inner calling that supersedes all external
              callings. They are above average gifts and potential.
              Positive, aware and an alive to the present
              moment.&nbsp;Having an undying conviction that the needed
              in-sight, knowledge, or wisdom will present itself at the
              needed moment. To help the impossible to become the
              possible. And convinced that the good, will prevail in the
              end. Knowing that a posture of hopelessness impedes the
              healing process. And that one need not accept the words,
              "never" and "can't". Surely by now in this day and age,
              nothing should be assumed as being impossible. The
              impossible just takes a little bit longer to become a
              reality. <br>
              <br>
              Are these written qualities, a possibility in persons'
              life? In this millennium? As we move in and out of all the
              verities of living, day by day. Is it just possible that
              we of the human race have sold ourselves short? Short
              changed our possibilities and ourselves, as well. For
              there seems to be far more evidence on a daily basis,
              through out the world, in all walks of life. The big,
              little and small, the tall and the short; man, woman or
              child. That we; the Human Race are not as bad, as perverse
              as the pundits of the media, or the gurus of the religious
              quarters would have us to believe. <br>
              <br>
              Do we have some miss directed people on this spinning
              globe of ours? Yes!&nbsp;But they are a small fraction
              out of six billion plus {six thousand million} peoples.
              The {bread and butter} public, those who are trying to
              keep body and soul together, whether they are in Northern
              Ireland, Indonesia, Shari Lanka, Bosnia or the Congo, or
              wherever. All are not the Militia, the terrorists, not
              running around trying to kill somebody. They are not the
              members of the Drug Cartels or the Mafia. They do not
              frequent jails and prisons, or beat their wives and
              children. Or kick the cat. They are just "plain vanilla"
              people, the Joe and Joans' of the world. <br>
              <br>
              If one reads the newspapers of the World on a daily basis,
              listens to the news on the radio, views the nightly news
              on television. Listens to daily chatter as people meet.
              One is led to believe that we are going to...You guessed
              it, to "h-e double toothpicks" We all know that "good
              news" does not sell copies, nor does it get good ratings
              on the tube. But, "hey!" between our constant singing the
              "woes" of the world. And the Media saturating us day and
              night with the violence and corruption of the world {wars,
              rapes, killings, etc.} Is it any wonder that we have
              become perplexed and paranoid? The citizens of the World
              need a breath of fresh air, to get rid of the stench, the
              smell of decay and death that is in the air. Day in and
              day out we are fed the same old menu. Maybe we need to
              pick up our newspapers one day and read "under a new
              management" Equal time will be given to the reporting of
              "the good, bad and ugly". <br>
              <br>
              It would be nice if we could have a balance. Why not? <br>
