                This earthly visitation is over for me.(Just kidding!)
                Will we meet again, possibly who really knows? Yes, yes!
                I know the words: " In My Father's house there are many
                mansions". But if you have met me and we have spoken
                about many things; "Fools, kings and everything, under
                the sun". Or if you have by chance, perhaps read
                anything I have ever written. Or heard me speak in a
                gathering. You know my feeling about pronouncements,
                exhortations and all such rhetoric, when it comes to
                speaking about the "Ineffable.".</font></div>

            <div><font face="Verdana, Arial">The fact being; we as
                limited finite beings are caught in time and
                space.&nbsp;Causing fragmentation in our thinking.
                Consequentially or seemingly,&nbsp;we rely&nbsp;heavily
                on forming logical sequential thought patterns. Many of
                which we have inherited out of our own life scripting,
                which is highly dependent on the scripting of
                yesteryear. All of which spells an incompleteness, a
                lack of unity, a wholeness. A myopic view of ourselves;
                the world, people and the things of the world. Of
                reality as it just is.
                <p>My life, up to this point in time&nbsp;has been one
                  great adventure. I have spent my life seeking and
                  searching the answers to three questions. Which have
                  been with me since around twelve years of age; "Who am
                  I?" "Why am I here?" And what am I, to be about?
                  {Going to where?] I have asked, looked and listened. I
                  have studied all manners of things. I have worked,
                  here there and everywhere. I have been to the top of
                  the mountain and walked in the valley below. I've
                  experienced the best of times and the worst of times,
                  while walking in and out of the shadows, into the sun.
                  I have had my dreams and I have lived my dreams. I
                  have had my wins and my losses. How fortunate, I have
                  been.</p>
                <p>I have loved, laughed and lost. I have felt the
                  warmth and closeness of women. As well as their
                  coldness, separateness and disaffection. But all in
                  all, love has been good to me, along the way. There
                  have been those moments of sheer ecstasy and
                  communion. That has touched the hem of the heavens.
                  And then those" thorny" moments that bleed
                  relationships of their innocence and purity. What is
                  that old saying; "It is better to have loved and lost.
                  Than to never have loved at all". But I would add a
                  note to that quote. I have never felt that any
                  experience or relationship, that was less than
                  complete, was a loss. The very experience of anything
                  has its value, if one can only see. Becoming aware of
                  the moment and the very" thus-ness" of that particular
                  moment.</p>
                <p>Regrets, yes, but only a few. They happened, but the
                  past is the past. And should be left in the past. .
                  Life is for the joy of living. Sad but true, to many
                  worry about the past which they cannot change. Or the
                  future which may never be. If we will but take care of
                  today.&nbsp;Doing that which is necessary, as opposed
                  to that which is unnecessary, our pasts and futures
                  will be just fine.</p>
                <p>Since this is being written before my demise. And
                  since the date of my departure from this spinning
                  globe has yet to be. As to where or when, I may out
                  live these present musings. And they will have lost
                  their "intent." Or, I may in the meantime have
                  discovered that the best message. Should have been one
                  of silence. No message at all.</p>
                <p>Yet, I feel compelled to say my piece, to recite my
                  litany. Although I would ask of those who might read
                  these words. To please remember, that the word is but
                  a mere re-presentation of that which "just is." That
                  I, the observer am not that which is observed. And
                  that my words in describing, is not the described.
                  That which I perceive is not necessarily "the" Reality
                  that just is. It is each persons' responsibility to
                  see and hear for themselves. And not climb any
                  mountain, while being carried up on someone elses'
                  back. It is the journey that is important, not so much
                  the destination. For the map is never the territory.</p>
                <p>Both the seeing and hearing needs to be; seeing and
                  hearing at its' highest intensity. {An intense,
                  passionate attentiveness.} A total giving of oneself
                  to the moment, attending to that at hand. A perception
                  that is centered, focused in on with the intent to
                  inquiry within, to witness "the Reality" of the
                  object, animate or inanimate. Bringing no prior
                  conceived conclusions, judgements, biases or
                  prejudices to the table. To see the actuality, the
                  reality as it is, not as one wishes it to be.</p>
                <p>Sort of seeing with our ears and hearing with our
                  eyes. Are we not more prone to look and listen, than
                  to see and hear? Our attention span seems to be the
                  culprit, because our minds suffer from "wanderlust."
                  Our constant chattering mind robs us of both hearing
                  and seeing, plus&nbsp; seemingly need to live in the
                  past and the future while but existing in the present.
                  All of which affects both sight and sound.</p>
                <p>I hesitated to write the word "listening." Simply
                  because, to many say that they are listening. When in
                  fact they are listening to their own chattering mind,
                  that is usually evaluating, assessing and judging as
                  to what is being said, in conjunction with some prior
                  images from out of the past. Consequently what is
                  being said is being filtered through many preconceived
                  images and reality structures that are issued out of
                  our fragmentary thinking. And we see the moment in the
                  grave-clothes of yesterday.</p>
                <p>The realities that exist outside the paradigms of the
                  mind, is Reality as it is. Once this same Reality is
                  submerged within our minds. It resembles, or rather it
                  is much like that which happens when we take a
                  straight stick and submerge it, into water. It appears
                  distorted, although we know that it is not. For we
                  have seen the reality of the stick before we submerged
                  it. When we know Reality for what it is, then we know
                  false realty, for what it is not, or vice versa.</p>
                <p>I hope you are not only seeing the words but also
                  hearing the subtle nuances, Which is behind, above and
                  below the words. The silence of "attention", is the
                  criterion, for&nbsp;one to&nbsp;sees and
                  listens.&nbsp;Here the&nbsp;invisible is made visible;
                  we know, we know.</p>
                <p>I knew you were going to ask, how do we know? And I
                  am going to say; "I do not know". As they say, "how do
                  you like those apples?" Now I have another little
                  goodie for you; "you will know when you know." Nothing
                  like cryptic statements, yes? Come walk with me for a
                  while. Let us see and hear, let us see if we can hear
                  with our eyes and see with our ears.</p>
                <p>There in the shadows is crouched a child whose skin
                  is punctuated by protruding bones and eyes that are
                  receding further and further back into his head. Could
                  be your child in fact it is your child in a way.</p>
                <p>And over there, a young girl trying to wash away the
                  shame of rape by a freedom-fighter. Who believes that,
                  the enemy is but an animal. To be killed or
                  de-humanized.</p>
                <p>And there! Look. See that woman seated in the midst
                  of that rubble, holding her two dead children close to
                  her breast, as she rocks back and forth in her agony
                  and pain.</p>
                <p>Over there, that small barefooted boy armed with an
                  AK 47 who has been forced to fight and kill&nbsp;in a
                  war that is not his. Nor of his making.</p>
                <p>See the millions upon millions and beyond, as they go
                  about their daily lives in the midst of the most
                  appalling living conditions, imaginable. Sleeping,
                  living and eating {when food is to be found} in places
                  that are as small as some of the closets; one would
                  find in the houses of the Western world. See also, the
                  most horrendous hygienic and sanitation conditions
                  that would stagger ones' rationality. Where water is a
                  luxury, and the water that is used, if and when there
                  is any. Would cause the analysts at the" Disease

                <div>See with your ears, the teeming masses that can not
                  read or write. One billion was the last count. And
                  then listen to the gibe pronouncements of the leaders
                  and politicians of the third world countries that
                  herald the fact that they have forty, fifty or eighty
                  percent literacy. Whose accuracy is questionable?
                  Which means many can, only minimally read and write
                  and they must face the twenty-first
                  highly&nbsp;technological century; like lambs led to a
                  slaughter. But why should they {the elite} worry,
                  their children are educated in the best
                  of&nbsp;schools. The peoples' money can buy. Their
                  motto is. " Let us keep education in the family". "
                  Educating the poor only leads to trouble."</div>

                <div>Have you seen enough? </div>
                <div>&nbsp;</div>
                <div>There is more; the displaced millions because of
                  war, killings and harassment. And then there is all
                  the disenfranchised, due to all the subtle ways "Man"
                  has invented to separate one human from another. Via;
                  class distinctions, caste systems, religion, language,
                  tradition and custom. Pitting one against the other.
                  We are Asians, Westerners, Europeans, Russians,
                  Hindus, Christians, Islamic, Buddhists, Englishmen,
                  Germans, Chinese, etc., etc. How sad! We are but one
                  race," the "Human Race." Yet we have chosen to
                  catalogue, classify and to categorize ourselves. We
                  rally around our nationalism, our specified religions,
                  status, power, property and possessions. We fragment
                  everything we get our hands on. Seemingly, we are not
                  satisfied unless we create disorder, chaos, misery and
                  strife. Plus, not to mention the loneliness,
                  emptiness, despair, discontent, insecurity, pain and
                  sorrow, we throw into the mix.</div>
                <p>Do I hear a cry? "No not I,"&nbsp; I am not
                  responsible for any of this! I just mind my own
                  business and do my thing. I am not part of all the
                  confusion and problems of the World. It is just "Molly
                  and me and baby makes three". But are we not the World
                  and the World, is it not you and I? Think about it
                  just for a moment. Would the World be like it is?
                  Without us, good, bad or indifferent? I am not just
                  speaking about the physical world. Which we repeatedly
                  rape. And are methodically destroying day by day. But
                  I am also speaking of our propensity for the more
                  subtle ways we destroy, as we de-humanize and de-self
                  one another. Which we are so skilled in doing, at
                  times.</p>
                <p>The "seeing and the hearing", how very important this
                  is as you walk, the byways and pathways of life. In
                  and out of the moments of daily living. Your second by
                  second encounter with "all and everything". "Seeing
                  and hearing" reality as it is." Brings forth attention
                  and awareness, or is it the other way around.
                  Attention and awareness gives birth to really seeing
                  and hearing. Forget about the batting order or the egg
                  and the chicken issue. Just do it, either one or the
                  other or both. And you and the World will be better
                  for it. But do not take my word or words for all this.
                  Just try it, you might like it. And furthermore, don't
                  knock it until you have given it a fair shake.</p>
                <p>As I often repeat; the word, the description, the
                  seen, the known, the heard, is not Reality.
                  Reality,&nbsp;just is. Reality hides in between the
                  words and phrases, above and below the seen and heard,
                  behind all those varied ways we experience the many
                  impressions of living. That filters in and
                  out&nbsp;of&nbsp;the brain, this mind of ours. That so
                  capable of selective amnesia.</p>
                <p>In all our knowledge, we share it with our ignorance.</p>
                <p>We cannot will Truth, or for that fact; we cannot
                  will Virtue, Freedom, Love, Compassion, or Goodness?
                  These just are, they "come in the night" so to speak.
                  They are not on command. They cannot be a result of
                  effort, or a decision on our part. For in doing so
                  they would&nbsp;lose their "is-ness", their purity.
                  And become fragmented&nbsp;because our thinking is
                  fragmented. "Aye, here is the rub. " We don't find the
                  above, they find us. They are not lost, we are. As I
                  said to someone in the past; "they wouldn't recognize
                  "Love", if it jump up and kissed them". Because there
                  mind, body and heart is always somewhere else. In this
                  case, the person was so preoccupied with "self", the
                  present was oblivious to them. The self-chattering of
                  their mind took center-stage. Their fears, anxieties,
                  guilt and shame over shadowed all their relationships</p>
                <p>Back to this finding by not finding. We have been so
                  conditioned, so programmed by our education, by
                  parental, societal and peer influence. We have
                  convinced ourselves that everything worth having must
                  be attained by strenuous effort in relation to that
                  particular goal. <br>
                  The answer is yes and no. In some things a
                  concentrated effort is needed. To achieve excellence,
                  to win the Gold at the Olympics, etc. In the "Becoming
                  and Being" the Truth, Beauty, Goodness, and Love. The
                  words, "Be still and know" holds the secret.</p>
                <p>There is an old story that comes to mind. Someone
                  once asked a Steamboat Captain on the Mississippi
                  River; if he knew where all the sand bars and the
                  submerged logs were. His answer was, "No". " But I
                  knows where they ain't". We may not be able to search
                  out, to find Truth. But we can search out and find
                  that which is false. Fact: War does not solve our
                  problems. Here we ask, for one to look at the actually
                  of life, as it is. To see and hear the disorder and
                  the chaos, the pain and the sorrow, the emptiness,
                  despair, poverty of the spirit plus all the
                  indictments against our fragmented society. It is in
                  seeing and hearing that which is not true, that which
                  is false. That helps the soil to be prepared. "Be
                  still and know". Truth is but a breath away.</p>
                <p>The din and the chatter of the World and of our minds
                  rob us of our need for silence. Or we could say our
                  need for space. For silence is space or vice versa.
                  There is a great need for a "time out" in this
                  constant confusion and disorder both in our lives and
                  in society. A time to smell the roses and stop this
                  frantic running after. When in truth, things are
                  chasing us.</p>
                <p>The philosopher, Descartes said; "I think, therefore
                  I am". As to what we have been discussing. We are and
                  the world is, what we think. And herein lies our
                  problem. Since our experiencing, our memories and our
                  knowledge is incomplete and fragmented. So are we, and
                  so is our world. For we are the World, as of now. We
                  cannot separate the two. We cannot blame the World;
                  the World was find until we came upon the scene. And
                  it has never been the same since. It would help if we
                  could say; "I am aware, therefore I am".</p>
                <p>Here, we are using "awareness" in the sense of being
                  attentive, to attend to "all and everything". To give
                  of our attention too. To be "alive"" to the moment. As
                  the parable goes, when the wise man was asked. "What
                  does attention mean?" His reply was;" Attention means
                  Attention". And again if one strives, try's to use
                  ones' will and effort. The attention we are speaking
                  about will never come to pass. This attention comes
                  out of the "sea of silence." It just is.</p>
                <p>We are not talking about concentration. For
                  concentration involves effort, a striving after a
                  goal. Which in turn places the mind in a conflicting
                  role. A struggling that entails moving from what is to
                  what should be. In this case a centering, a focusing
                  that is forced.</p>
                <p>We associate such words as being riveted to or having
                  a rapped attention. The type of attention one has when
                  they are into a book or in watching a very suspenseful
                  movie. The residual quality of this sort of attention
                  is found in the non-critical. Of not judging,
                  evaluating or assessing at the point of entry into the
                  moment, into the "Now". In way we are speaking about
                  an emptiness of the mind. Where thought, is
                  momentarily suspended. And the moment holds
                  center-stage. And we are single-minded at this
                  intersection. The "me" the "I" and the "my" has left
                  the scene. While the moment stands alone,
                  unencumbered, on its' own merit and speaks out of the
                  "sea of silence". I do not mean for this to sound
                  obtuse or esoteric. For it is neither. It is natural,
                  actual and factual, it just is. Just <strong>be</strong>
                  "silence". Do not use the will, or effort, <strong>just
                    be it.</strong> . Just do it. Cease the mind
                  chatter, the usual linear thinking. Just be it and do
                  it.</p>
                <p>{Note}</p>
                <p>When we hear the words, emptiness of the mind, or
                  words to that effect. We envision a type of
                  mindlessness, "a ship without a rudder". This is not
                  the intent of the word. The emptying of the mind
                  refers to the temporary stoppage of thoughts. As one
                  is meditating, as one is into those areas that are
                  beyond basic sequential linear thought. We cannot nor
                  should we give up thinking. It is essential for this
                  time and space and for daily activities. But when it
                  comes to the psychologically domains. Thinking can
                  become a liability. To many think themselves into more
                  conflict and confusion, misery, sorrow and loneliness;
                  than their mind can cope with</p>
                <p>I have talked throughout my life about the importance
                  of self-knowledge, a knowledge that can lead one to
                  self-understanding, on to self-awareness, to becoming,
                  <strong>a being</strong>. A seeing within, so we might
                  understand the complexity of our own human nature. As
                  to how we perceive, think and do. We at times refer to
                  this, as having in-sight. Insight allows us to have
                  out-sight-ness. By this we mean; by looking inside
                  one's self, it allows one to see and know reality as
                  it is. This type of seeing, of knowing allows one to
                  see the fragmentary aspects of our piecemeal knowledge
                  which we have inherited out of our own script writing;
                  as we have perceived life up through our staging
                  years. And it points up, the glaring deficiencies of
                  the fragmented thinking of past civilizations. With
                  all the myths, superstitions and false reality. It is
                  important that we understand that our experiences, our
                  perception, our knowledge and our memories are but
                  partial pieces of that Reality which just is. And that
                  this is equally true of the inherited knowledge from
                  out of the eons of time.</p>
                <p>It is certainly a fact that one can think and do {in
                  most cases, pretty much what they want or desire}.
                  Choice becomes a factor in this process of thinking
                  and doing. The choices we make structure our own
                  personal realities. As to how we see ourselves,
                  others, the World and the things of the World. But in
                  light of what we have been speaking about. As to our
                  fragmentary thoughts and the inherited fragmentary
                  thinking out of the past. It is necessary for us to
                  ask ourselves. What is real as opposed to that which
                  is unreal? To ask of our selves, what is Truth as
                  opposed to that which is false? To ask of ourselves,
                  as to what is Light as opposed to that which is
                  darkness? And to ask ourselves as to what is necessary
                  as opposed to that which is unnecessary? In living a
                  life in balance and harmony, with "all and
                  everything". Recognizing the fact that we belong and
                  are part of the "Human Family". And that we are
                  Children of the Universe and beyond. We are the"
                  Inheritors" of all there is or ever will be. How odd
                  it is that we are not more thankful than we are? Why
                  is this so?</p>
                <p>Well, I have said my piece. Lived my life and liked
                  it. To borrow the lines from "The Chairman of The
                  Board", Mr.'' S'', "I did it my way". Come to think
                  about it. That song pretty well, says it. For life has
                  been good to me. And&nbsp; when the "Walk" is
                  finished.&nbsp;Just maybe, along the "way". My
                  "Being", my Presence caused someone to ask of
                  themselves; "who am I, why am I here and where am I
                  going?</p>
                <p>Till we meet again.........</p>

                <p>PS.</p>
                <p>I said in the above text that I had very few regrets
                  in life, which is true. For if my life would have been
                  different. I would not be writing as I am now. Nor
                  would I have done all the things that I have done up
                  to this point in my life. For I have seen, heard and
                  experienced enough for a half a dozen lives. How
                  privileged I have been. And for all this I am indeed
                  thankful.</p>
