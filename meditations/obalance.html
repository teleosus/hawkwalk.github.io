                three things in ones' life? Is it possible? And why is
                it so hard to do? <br>
                <br>
                First off, there is no prescribe way, or method. No,
                one, two or three easy steps to balance, harmony and
                peace. The integration of oneself and the World into a
                unified coalition, is no mean task. Can it be done. The
                answer is "yes". Why? Because the answer to any problem
                can be found in the problem itself.. And in nine out of
                ten cases, if we our involved in said problem, we are
                the problem. And because this is true, we run as fast as
                we can away, from solving the problem. We do not like
                confrontations with ourselves, others or the world.
                Confrontations make us feel very uncomfortable. One of
                the reasons for this lies in the actuality, that a
                change may be call for. Which will ask us to leave those
                things, which are comfortable and non-threatening to us.
                We love our comfort zones, right? <br>
                <br>
                Let's look at these three words separately. Balance,
                what is it?. What does it mean? How would we know if
                someone was balanced? What would be his or her demeanor,
                physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually? In
                other words how would they speak, what would be the
                nuance of their speech, their words and actions, day by
                day? Stressful, negative. nervous, bland indecisive,
                uncertain, fearful, boring, alive, dead, non-committal,
                positive, alive, happy, caring, compassionate, doom and
                gloom, emotional , passive, excited, enthused,
                empowering, affirming, fearful, apprehensive, deceiving,
                truthful, wise, weak, forceful, empty, hollow, selfish,
                pretentious, over-bearing, arrogant, indifferent,
                apathetic, anxious, obsessed, pessimistic, calm,
                certainty, confident, courageous , gentle,
                knowledgeable, aware, flexible, attentive, vital,
                energetic, influential, serene, purposeful, cheerful,
                creative, insightful, conscientious and loving? <br>
                <br>
                Now all of a sudden, we have not only three words to
                look at, but a mini-dictionary
                to look in-to. To gain some in-sight about what is
                behind the words; balance,
                harmony and peace plus all these other words we have
                mentioned.</font></div>
            <div><font face="Verdana, Arial">
                <br>
                Let's stick with speech and a person's word selection a
                little longer. Before moving on to gestures, manner,
                impression, and appearance. How one speaks, the words he
                or she chooses, or the words not chosen.? What one
                speaks about or that which they never speak about? Or
                seldom speak about. In asking how one speaks, we are
                asking in what manner, sound, strength, intensity is one
                speaking. Is it, with uncertainty, a passivity, an
                indifference, an apathy. You get the point. We are not
                nit-picking here. We are trying to find out what is
                'balance, harmony and peace'. But we will try to arrive
                through the back door, by finding out, by looking into
                imbalance, disorder and conflict. Most people in their
                right mind would opt for order, balance and unity in
                their lives. Would you agree? Yes! <br>
                <br>
                Balance, harmony and peace is an out-growth of being
                aware, of being perceptive to that which we are a part
                of, as we encounter life. It is attending to, being
                intent on what is happening around us. A seeing with our
                ears and hearing with our eyes? This allows us to be
                alive to the moment, the "now".
                <p>If one is a million miles away as another is speaking
                  or they are pre-occupied with the chattering that is
                  going on in their own mind while another is speaking.
                  Their responses are predictable, as are their choice
                  of words. They are some-where else. Here is a case, or
                  a fact of not being in tune, in balance, harmony or at
                  peace with oneself. And certainly not with the person
                  who is speaking, or trying to speak. Small detail you
                  say; "not so" because attending to the moment, to that
                  which is at hand is part of being balanced, in harmony
                  and at peace with oneself and everything else. If we
                  fail to hear and see what is going on around us, if we
                  are so occupied with our own confusion and disorder
                  that it isolates us from the moment, from being there
                  instead of somewhere else. We are entering the
                  unbalanced area. We are living in our reality, a
                  reality that we have structured. A reality that limits
                  and prevents us from experiencing the moment, the
                  "now". Relationships and the World around us. Our
                  worries doubts, anxieties, fears, shame guilt and all
                  the other proclivities we hang onto isolate us from
                  the real world. And from who we really are. Is this to
                  simplistic, maybe?. To naive, maybe? <br>
                  <br>
                  But we are not quite finished, yet. One needs to
                  decide as to what has been said so far. What is
                  balanced and what is unbalanced. What enhances or
                  hinders balance? How about the mini-dictionary?
                  Mentally try to check off those words as to their
                  intent, wither they would help or hinder the
                  possibilities of balance, harmony and peace. <br>
                  <br>
                  We mentioned some external signs, some body language
                  we use along with voice and words to convey what we
                  are trying say, This silent language in a way, is an
                  expressed image. It is an image that speaks a thousand
                  words. Coupled with, what we actually end up doing.
                  Both of these speaks more about balance and the
                  unbalanced, harmony and disorder, peace and conflict
                  than the spoken word. Talking a good fight does not
                  get the Gold Medal. <br>
                  <br>
                  The tone, volume, strength and vitality of the voice.
                  The light of the eyes, the energy they emit. The
                  posture of the body, its tone or lack of tone. Also
                  its energy. How one moves; is there an alive-ness or a
                  deadness to the bodys' movement? We are talking about
                  how one walks, talks, acts, works, makes love, washes
                  dishes, scrubs the floor, or whatever ones' daily
                  routines is. Is it alive or dead? <br>
                  <br>
                  How about our attitudes ? Our attitude towards
                  ourselves, towards others. The World and the things of
                  the world. How is our self-esteem, self-respect,
                  self-worth, self-reliance, confidence, feeling of
                  security, of self-sufficiency.? Do we like ourselves
                  and how about others? <br>
                  <br>
                  Do we react or pro-act to life? Are we good at what we
                  do? Improving and learning all the time? Or are we
                  lazy, always procrastinating? Do we do more than is
                  expected? Or just enough to get by? <br>
                  <br>
                  Are we whiners? Always, complaining about all and
                  everything. Nothing is right. There is not enough sun,
                  there is to much sun. No rain, to much rain. Why are
                  some of us never satisfied? It's the government, the
                  politicians, the neighbors, "they, those, them",
                  always somebody who is to blame for their miserable,
                  petty lives. The complainers of the world can find
                  nothing to be thankful for. They don't love or like
                  themselves, let alone anybody or anything else. They
                  are the Joan and Joe Glooms of the World, the party
                  poopers of the World. They try their best to ruin
                  everyone's parade, if possible. Their skies are always
                  cloudy; with a storm coming. Is this balance or
                  unbalance? <br>
                  <br>
                  Confusion, disorder, conflict, out of sync, at war
                  within, indecisiveness, uncertainty and fear, are the
                  "enemies of the state" The state of harmony and peace.</p>
