        <tr>
          <td valign="middle" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial">Were
              we born to be free, without restraints, limitations and
              controls? Would we agree that this is true? Some do, and
              live their life according, as though it is true. But we
              ask: are we free simply to make random choices, because we
              affirm that we are free? Are we ever free in our mind,
              heart and spirit? Is this possible? Yes!
              <p>And by freedom we do not mean; the license, to do what
                we want, when we want? This freedom of choice, this
                freedom to decide for ourselves carry with it a
                response-ability of discrimination. So we might choose
                between those things which are necessary as opposed to
                those things that are unnecessary. In light of that
                which is the best, better or more excellent for us and
                others. If this is to be so; then a certain amount of
                self-knowledge and self-understanding is needed to help
                facilitate this process. Plus, the skill of
                discriminating between that which is Real as opposed to
                that which is Unreal. And that which is Truth as opposed
                to that which is False. </p>
              <p>The question ;"Are we ever free?" Is always there,
                until each answers the question themselves. </p>
              <p>The word "freedom" has suffered almost as much as the
                over-worn, glibly used word, we call "love". There is;
                freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of
                worship, freedom to vote, freedom to bear arms, freedom
                to express ourselves in writing, or in other forms of
                media. And even the freedom to live or to die. We have
                stretched all these various freedoms to their utmost
                limits and in doing so; we have in some cases violated
                good common-sense to protect them. </p>
              <p>The "cry for freedom" has been the "clarion call" that
                has split the heavens ever since that point in time,
                when ""We"" finally realized that we had dominion over
                all there was. And then again when the light dawned;
                that we alone had been given the power and the gifts to
                transform and change the path of evolution; in the way
                it would evolve. </p>
              <p>And whether we like it or not this fact is unfolding
                once again before our very eyes and picking up momentum,
                each and every second. We have "The Race" towards the
                speed of light. The "Race" to create {to clone or not to
                clone?} "a race" is on. The beginnings to bring about
                "One World". The beginnings of colonizing and living in
                outer space. These possibilities are on the horizons. </p>
            </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">That which sets us apart
                within the animal kingdom is the gift of 'free choice
                and the gift of reasoning'. Allowing us to consciously
                make a decision; to choose, between this and that. From
                the very moment we took that first breath and took our
                place in "time and space". These two gifts as well as
                many others were just waiting to unfold. But as the
                pages of our calendars began to fall away. Little by
                little,we begin to die daily in so many ways. Allowing
                the walls of limitation to shrink our dreams and hopes.
                Along with our ability to make those life choices, so
                needed to keep us among the living; instead of the
                walking dead. And our "cry for freedom" has to often
                been reduced to a whisper. As resignation climbed up
                into our laps.</font></p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial">
              <div>Sadly we squander so many of the gifts which we have
                so graciously been given. How is this so? Why? Is it
                because we have become still born, due to neglect. Or is
                it because we have not become aware of who and what we
                are?</div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>We ask; does the reason lie in the fact that not only
                do we not know who we are and why we are here in this
                particular time and space? We do not know in many
                instances, why we say and do the things we do.? We
                humorously say; "the devil made me do it." What is it
                that causes us to do so many idiotic, irrational
                things?. Why do we suffer from mental anemia? We act at
                times as though a frontal lobotomy has been perform.
                Why? Because we do not see life as it is. We see life as
                we choose to see it. As we want, expect, and wish it to
                be. Along with fact that we have been told that life is
                such and such a way. By everybody and everything. And
                "yes" even by ourselves. As we have repeatedly said; we
                structure our own reality. </div>
              <p>We are not aware of how we think, why we think as we do
                or do as we do. We are not aware of the multiplicity of
                influences that bombard us daily. And have ever single
                day of our lives since the day one. We are not aware
                that we are the product of centuries "ad infinitum" of
                fragmentary thinking. Years piled upon years of partial
                thinking, of piecemeal thinking, of simplistic thinking.
                All our sciences, philosophies, religions, economics,
                politics, academics now and then suffer because of this.
                The entire fabric of all our past civilizations, up to
                the present and even the present itself have been
                affected and influence by this virus; this virus of
                fragmentation. We see only partially, yes! </p>
              <p>We are like the five wise blind men that were sent out
                from their Village. A Village where all the inhabitants
                were blind; to examine an elephant that was tied to a
                tree just out side their walls. The owner of the
                elephant could see but could not speak. So he took the
                five blind men and placed them around the elephant.
                After the men return back to their village. They were
                asked to describe to everyone what was the elephant
                like?. One said, that it was very big and it felt like a
                huge leather wall. Another who had been standing by the
                leg, said, it was like a huge tree. The third one who
                felt the ear of the elephant, agreed with his friend,
                that it was like a tree for he had touched a large palm
                leaf. The fourth said, "no", they were all wrong. It was
                like a snake a big snake., as he had touched the trunk.
                The last one would have none of his friends
                explanations. He said, there was no elephant. For you
                see he had gotten turned around, and headed in the wrong
                direction. </p>
              <p>All the collective and consensual experiences, memories
                and knowledge of the past and that of the "Now", were
                and are of the same nature as the blind men's
                observations and their knowledge of. We do not have the
                'whole enchilada'. The puzzle is incomplete. But we are
                getting there. What did the little worm say; " It's a
                cinch inch by inch." </p>
              <p>If we are to be free to make the right choices, be
                whole and complete. It is important that we be aware of
                the influences and the conditioning, that limits us. And
                how these influences have come into being and been given
                life "The truth of this can {indeed} set us free". And
                we can just be, be that which we were intended to be and
                are. </p>
              <p>In other writings, we have said that, we have the
                possibility of being "Truth." That one can become
                "Truth." Yes, this is or can be a reality. But at the
                same time this possibility is not achieved by any effort
                or striving on our part. For it is this very effort and
                striving that throws us into the conflict between trying
                to be; what we believe, or think we should be over and
                against that which we believe we are. Or, what others,
                or some belief, or system, or whatever we have
                identified ourselves with to achieve this end of self
                improvement says we should be. There can be no freedom,
                no truth, if conflict and self-identification enters
                into the picture </p>
              <p>This conflict and self-identification we get grabbed
                by, are two of the main culprits that keep us from
                seeing, from being aware of that which "just is". With
                things as they are. With the very now-ness of the
                moment. With the actually, the reality of all our
                relationships with the World, with others and the things
                of this World. These two, twin assassins keep you and I
                from being ourselves in the truest sense. These two, rob
                us of our selfhood, our freedom, our creativity, our
                awareness, our spontaneity and our alive- ness. And the
                list goes on. </p>
              <p>I am going close this out by simply saying; if anyone
                is passionately, intensely interested in finding out the
                why and wherefore of the living process of life. And how
                one fits into the ""Wholeness"" of "All and Everything."
                One first needs to solve the problem of why, we do not
                know what life is all about? Since we represent and are
                life. The same as we are the World, and the World is us.
                The problems of the World, and our personal worlds. Are
                one and the same. The solution to both of these, lies
                within us. Because we are the problem. Of course if we
                do not believe this to be true. There is little left to
                say, wouldn't you agree. </p>
              <p>But if by chance, perhaps you are interested in coming
                to terms, with who and what you are? And why you are
                here. Let the "Recovery" begin. Always remembering, that
                things are not necessarily what they seem to be. I can
                offer no methods, no systems, no belief structures, no
                chiseled thought or idea. But I will say, become a
                learner, a life time learner. And it would be best if
                one does not become a follower or an imitator. Both of
                these keeps the mind from remaining fresh, alive, aware
                and innocence. While at the same time, setting up
                boundaries and limitations. Killing the freedom to
                become and be. </p>
              <p>And along the way, inquire, look into the following
                words and see if they might speak to you, "Know thyself"
                and "Unto thyself be true." </p>
              <p>Happy trails!</p>
