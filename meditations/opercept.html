          <td valign="middle" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial">Recently,
              to be precise on March 13, 2000, I received an Email that
              read as follows;
              <p>"How can you say half the things on your web-site?
                Knowing the type of person you really are? A father who
                never took any responsibility in the raising of two
                children out of three. </p>
              <p>{A comment needs to be added at this point} </p>
              <p>It was not two out of three. It was three out of three,
                in keeping with the inferred reference above. </p>
              <p>{But to continue} </p>
              <p>Shows up on a whim after what twenty some odd years,
                and acts like nothing has taken place. I was just to
                damned shocked that I could hardly speak and that is not
                normal for me. I take care of myself without help since
                that is how it has been for the majority of my life. You
                threw me away is how I perceived it. Did you every think
                about that; really think about how it affected me? No, I
                would guess not. Since all I was introduced to was a
                self-centered, stuck on himself, old man who could only
                talk about this wonderful life that he led without us.
                Like I really wanted to hear about your happiness
                {self-centered}. </p>
              <p>Get my drift. Just food for thought! </p>
              <p>P.S. Do not sell my information for money. </p>
              <p>This message was written by my youngest of two
                daughters. Her mother is referred to as Babs on my
                web-site. Mentioned both in the Micro and the Macro
                Bio's. Kerry was one an a half years old and her brother
                Mark was seven when the divorce to Babs took place. We
                had been married for eleven tumultuous years. Years of
                conflict and discord that had its' genesis in my
                choosing to be a minister. And Babs not wanting to be a
                Ministers' wife. Her favorite barb; "You chose to become
                a minister, I didn't. I never wanted to be ministers'
                wife in the first place". </p>
              <p>In all reality, there should have been a divorce, six
                months after we were married. Before any children
                arrived on the scene. But this cock-eyed optimist was
                sure that time and growth would take care of the stormy
                weather but it did not prove to be so. </p>
              <p>What each of us wanted out of life; how we perceived
                life? The priorities, the values, we each held or didn't
                hold were as "night and day". Outside the bedroom there
                could not have been two people less compatible. I
                believe and I believe Babs would agree that one of the
                main reasons she chose marriage. It was a way out of the
                house; a key to freedom. But as is so often the case,
                you cannot be free from yourself just by changing the
                scenery. You cannot run away from yourself. You take
                yourself along for the ride. </p>
              <p>The contents of the above letter was written by Kerry
                Leigh. Who was the younger of the two daughters. The
                context of the events and happenings during the
                eleven-year marriage prior to the divorce are examples
                of how we perceive others; the world and ourselves in
                general. We are talking about how we structure our own
                realities, or allow others to structure them for us. Can
                we ever be certain about anything? If we are not
                growing, evolving, becoming, being and doing, on a
                moment by moment basis. How can we know, if we are not;
                asking, seeking and searching, second by second? </p>
              <p>All three children of my first and second marriage know
                me only through the eyes" of their respective mothers.
                As to how they {the mothers} structured their realities
                during the marriages. Also; a knowledgeable assessment
                by the children of the daily events and experiences that
                took place during those chaotic eighteen years {seven
                and eleven} would be impossible because of their ages at
                the time of the divorces. </p>
              <p>It was during this eighteen-year period that I had time
                to think of the pros and cons of divorce and the ensuing
                consequences. I have never been a person that operates
                on a whim; I think this could be verified by my ex's. </p>
              <p>The word by word, action by action was non-existent to
                the children, except through the repeated words and
                memories of their mothers. Should either parent in a
                divorce which involves the very young. Feel the need to
                vent their anger, frustration, resentment or transfer
                their hatred to the children. One needs to ask; what is
                gained in this character assassination? Except maybe to
                bolster ones' self-esteem or to create the "good gal"
                and the "bad guy" scenario. To continually fuel the
                fires of resentment, down through the years. Is a type
                of programming that no child should be subjected too.
                The same, as no child should be subjected to an
                environment that is chaotic. </p>
              <p>To hold on to any form of negativism for ten, twenty,
                thirty years or a lifetime is a no win situation. Plus,
                negativism has a way of jumping up and biting the one
                who is doing the bidding. It definitely affects the
                mind; body and spirit of the one who cannot let go of
                the past. Those who are embittered, who have allowed the
                shadows out of the past to eclipse the sunlight of the
                present, of their "NOW's". Become less than they were
                intended to be; destroying their balance, harmony and
                peace. </p>
              <p>Throughout past writings I have alluded to the need for
                discrimination. If ever there is an area that needs
                discrimination. It is in this which we have been
                addressing. Our perceptivity of ourselves, others, the
                world and things of the world at times becomes jaded.
                For what we see or hear, may not be. It is up to each
                individual to discriminate between; the real from the
                unreal: the truth from the false and the light from the
                dark. Also, to choose that which is necessary over and
                against that which is unnecessary. This is a "cradle to
                the grave" task. Much of our personal conflict, misery
                and woe, as well as the worlds'. Is a product of
                improper perceptibility, as is our fragmented way of
                thinking. </p>
              <p>If the reader will bear with me, just for a moment, I
                would like to go to a different level in this discussion
                of how we perceive, or choose to perceive. We know;
                ourselves, others, the world and the things of the world
                via the mind and our bodily senses. But this knowing is
                transient and always in flux; besides being highly
                fragmented, making it limited in scope. </p>
              <p>This "I am-ness" which we have in previous writings
                referred too. Opposes the concept, the perception that
                we are mind, body, emotions and feelings. That this "I
                am-ness, not the former things we just mentioned, is the
                root of all experience. That this "awareness" can get
                rid of our limitations, the prison we have created for
                ourselves. </p>
              <p>"I am-ness" is Awareness with a capital "A". It is
                being conscious of consciousness; an awareness of
                awareness. A being aware that everything that exists,
                exists as the {"I-am"} There is no "this" or "that".
                There <b>just is,</b>. the "Eternal Now", the "I am"
                caught in an existential moment. This "now" we speak of,
                is timeless, no past, no future. Time, space and
                casualty do not apply to Reality. This "I am-ness" is
                prior to the world. The body, mind, time, space,
                casualty and the world appears and disappears on the
                screen of the "I am". The "I am" is the source of them
                all. They have no existence without the "I-am". There
                must be an experiencer to have an experience. For
                something to be manifested there has to be someone who
                perceives it. </p>
              <p>Now having proposed the importance of the "I am-ness".
                Quickly, let me say; It { I am} is not the Highest, the
                Absolute; for in a sense the "I am-ness" depends upon
                the world, body and mind. But when the body dies so does
                the "I am". But up until then, it is a benchmark along
                the way, a point of light. A possibility, a path to go
                beyond our human nature to our "Absolute Nature". To
                that "Imago Deo"; choose your term. We are talking about
                that which is indescribable. There are no words. It just
                <b>is</b> and always has been. </p>
              <p>Not to know, that we do not know, while at the same
                time deluding ourselves that we know is the height of
                ignorance. And we ask; to know and understand what? The
                "what" in this instance is that, which just <strong>is</strong>.
                Do we really know and understand who and what we are?
                Why we are? How do we perceive ourselves to be? </p>
              <p>In not having the answers to these quintessential
                questions, we have created an illusion that we are
                either "this" or "that" by identification and
                association with an endless number of things, which we
                have borne out of our piecemeal, fragmented thinking.
                Which we arrogantly call Reality. </p>
              <p>We are not "this" or "that". We just <b>are</b>. We
                are "All and Everything". Our problem lies in the fact
                that we cannot see Reality as it is, but rather we see
                it as we choose to see it. We create reality in our own
                image; everything takes on the stamp of our self-imposed
                perception. Which to repeat, is fragmented. Out of our
                partial sight, we have separated ourselves from our
                beginnings, our Ultimate Nature, others, the World and
                the things of the World. We are wanderers in the "far
                country". </p>
              <p>To return back; we need <b>to be</b>; who and what we
                are. What we have <b>always</b> been. To accomplish
                this, we need to see who and what we are not. To deny
                that which we have so conveniently imaged ourselves to
                be. Giving no more credence, or to breathe no more life
                into those images. Which we have created out of our own
                conflicts, confusion, fears, anxieties, shame or guilt.
                Due to our ignorance, our lack of knowledge and
                understanding about our true identity, our "Ultimate
                Nature". That: which we are. That: which we were"imaged"
                to be.. </p>
              <p>As has been said; we are both the problem and the
                solution. Until we get it right, the World will not be
                right. We are the World and because this is so; the
                problem, our problem, is in our "separateness". We have
                created and continue to create the gulfs, the divides,
                and the chasms. It is we who stand apart, one from the
                other. It is we who have invented all the expressions,
                the images, and the creeds, dogmas, rituals, traditions,
                customs, languages, institutions, and organizations,
                societies and governments, that spawn this separateness.
              </p>
              <p>We have further added to the problem of "separateness"
                by coining such words as; capitalists, socialists,
                communists, fundamentalists or conservative, liberal or
                libertarian. Then we have thrown in; American, British,
                French, and Asian. Or words like; Jewish, Christian,
                Islamic, Buddhist and the lists go on. Or whatever label
                we might invent or conjure up, to separate ourselves
                from "they, them and those". </p>
              <p>We talk about our kind of people, those who are
                like-minded. We catalogue, classify and categorize
                people into levels of importance or non-importance, or
                their acceptability, or levels of rightness, etc. </p>
              <p>We do everything in our power to devise ways, means and
                instruments to perpetuate this "separateness". Even to
                the point of the taking of lives. In creating this
                posture of "separateness"; we have lost ourselves, we
                have lost each other. We have lost "all and Everything".
                We are less than human, for we have lost our
                "humanness". Until we choose to close the gaps, the
                divides, of all those things which separate us. We will
                continue to create and live in a world of misery,
                despair, conflict and chaos. </p>
              <p>There is a great need for each of us to realize that we
                are one with "All and Everything". We, are family, even
                in our diversities. We are bound together, for we are of
                the "same substance". Out of the same "Source", the same
                "Image". And simply; because of "who and what", we just
                are, in the fullest sense. </p>
              <p>When each walks through the "door of perception" and
                becomes and is that which he or she was intended to be,
                "imaged" to be. Only then will the clothes of
                "separateness" fall away. And we will be one with " All
                and everything". And all with the "All in All." </p>
              <p>Several paragraphs back, we said that if we are to
                arrive at some knowledge and understanding of ourselves.
                Our hope lies in finding out who or what <strong>we are
                  not</strong>. Such as; we are not our bodies, our
                feelings and emotions, nor our thinking. Our "I am-ness"
                reaches out beyond our human nature, beyond the ego, the
                personality, the self, as we know it. This entity has
                been called by many names. Soul, spirit, essence,
                intrinsic core, one's Ultimate Nature or Being, the
                Over-self, "The Self ", the "Inner- Light", the Very
                Substance of the Very Substance. And last, but certainly
                not the least, the Christian affirmation, the "Imago
                Deo". </p>
              <p>Relating to the above semantics, we find such words as
                self-actualization {Goldsmith and Maslow},
                self-realization {Yoga}, Cosmic Consciousness {Bucke},
                God -consciousness or God-Mind, Unity Consciousness
                {Mysticism}, Christ-Consciousness {Christian}. </p>
              <p>It is not that we are lacking in reference points, or
                "points of light" along the way. Our problem of
                discovering, of seeking out the meaning of life. As to
                where we fit into the schema of things. Partially lies
                in our intent, our sincerity, our earnestness', our
                dedication and commitment in finding out. <b>"Who and
                  what we are not"</b>. So that we might best understand
                <b>"who and what we are"</b>. </p>
              <p>If we will but persevere, be singular in our seeking
                after the necessary versus the unnecessary. The real
                versus the unreal, the truth versus the false, the light
                versus the dark. It will come to be. That which; we are,
                <b>we will be</b>. And all separateness will fall away.
