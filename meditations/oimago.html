          <td valign="middle" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial">In
              past writings, we have referred to the many clamoring
              "I's" that vie for center stage in our lives. Becoming
              very vocal and persistent to the point of demanding that
              they be given full attention. That they and they alone are
              the last word, as to our true identity and as to the real
              meaning for our lives.
              <p>It is the consensus of the majority of Religions and
                that of the Esoteric Psychologies that we are much more
                than these "I's", these small "s" selves. Here we speak
                about the "Self" that part of us that rides above the
                mundane. This essence, this specialized Self, guides us
                and support us as the need arises. In the <i>yogic
                  texts</i>, we hear that "we must be as one with this
                Self and God". Here we are reminded of those words; "I
                and my father are one." I should have said our words,
                because they need to become and be, our "flesh and
                blood". </p>
              <p>We need to be aware and meditate on this "Self", to
                bring this "Self" in line with the" Mind of God" (The
                Will), the "Unity Consciousness, choose your preference.
                And after choosing your semantics; "become and be" that.
              </p>
              <p>The evidence points to the complacency of conventional
                Psychology in the ignoring of this super-consciousness
                {Cosmic Consciousness}. Except for a few visionaries
                (Bucke, Maslow and Goldstien) and their ilk. One has to
                decide for oneself the veracity and the very existence
                of this area of the mind. And whether it is the source
                for those meta-values, referred to by Mallow and others.
                Those of; unselfish love, concern and compassion. It is
                in this area, wherein lies the potentiality of higher
                psychic functions and spiritual energies. </p>
              <p>It is in this domain of the Real Self that the
                possibilities for the different dimensions of
                consciousness exist, and also the various ways of
                centering in on these possibilities. Both can enable us
                to grasp a non-dual Reality, as it is. Not as we choose
                it to be. We are talking about a Reality that is all
                inclusive. Inclusive of the mind, body and spirit, as a
                whole, no dichotomy. A unitive entity (Self) that is
                aware and alive. One that is involved in the perpetual
                process of growth and evolution in the psychological and
                the spiritual dimensions of ones' "Self". A process, a
                way which can, if one so chooses move one towards a
                becoming, a Being. That which we already are; That which
                is consciously connected with "All and Everything".
                Anything that is detrimental or counter-productive to
                this unification, is a betrayal of who, what and why we
                are. The same would apply to those things which
                diminishes the quality of the mind, body and spirit in a
                relative sense. </p>
              <p>We need to seriously ask ourselves, why there are those
                times when we think and act as our own worst enemy?
                Agreeing with Pogo when he said; "I saw the enemy and it
                was I". </p>
              <p>Betrayal to oneself or to others is never a pretty
                thing to be part of or to be a witness too. Partially
                because the very act is so demeaning and unworthy as to
                our "Intended Nature". As difficult as is
                the&nbsp;betrayal&nbsp;by someone who pretends and
                profess undying love. The consequences for the betrayer
                is even more difficult. Infidelity to oneself reaches
                heights of recrimination and guilt that becomes a mental
                nightmare filled with apprehension and anxiety. While at
                the same time distorting the relative reality and
                threatening all relationships. As well as ones' own
                self-worth, self-respect and that much needed acceptance
                of ones'&nbsp;self.. </p>
              <p>The self-doubt and low self-esteem created by
                infidelity spills over into all facets of ones 'personal
                activities. It tints everything, even the illicit
                relationship that lives by the breath of deceit. Reality
                becomes out of sync. Fantasies and defense mechanisms
                come center stage, affecting sensory perceptions and
                rationality. As the search for a scapegoat begins, so
                that the guilt can be soothed and the blame shifted to
                soften the shame. </p>
              <p>It is painful to watch this process&nbsp;either in a
                friend, or a loved one, who is caught up in their
                addiction and their subsequent&nbsp;self-denial.
                Sincerely believing; they are in control of their lives.
                That they can change their behavior anytime if they so
                wish.&nbsp; Some even believe that their infidelity is
                justified because of mitigating circumstances or because
                of another' behavior. </p>
            </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Whether the hook be alcohol,
                drugs, or sex that is being used as a crutch or as a
                temporary fix; for boredom, depression or stress. Or to
                drown ones weaknesses, guilt or shame. The final result
                ends in a separation from self or another or both.
                Spawning an imbalance and a suffering that eats away at
                the vital energies of ones' spirit. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Any attempt on ones' part to
                speak to this revolving door scenario, draws an
                immediate indignity and a rhetorical self- denial by the
                trapped person.&nbsp; Here a loved one can&nbsp;become
                the adversary, who is violating the trust and
                sensibilities of the offender. And we hear such words
                as; "How could you ever believe or doubt for one minute,
                my love and commitment to you." Here we see a role
                reversal taking place, where the victim becomes the
                villain and the villain becomes the victim. As someone
                once said; " the best defense is a strong offense. </font></p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial">
              <div>If one is of "well-being" and holds a high respect
                for themselves. Infidelity and betrayal is highly
                unlikely. Are there exceptions, yes! yes! yes!&nbsp;But
                by in large, loyalty to ones 'own self-knowledge and
                self-understanding of who they are protects them from
                this sort of illicit negativity, this exercise in
                self-defacing. But as they do say; "To err is human."
                But to repeat the same offense, is plain stupidity. </div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>To this equation; we ask the question. Where does
                love enter into the picture? Now we all know how much
                the word "love" has suffered, has been abused and lied
                about. But just for a moment let us look at a simple
                working definition of love: </div>
              <p>Love, is the giving of the best of oneself to another.
                The giving of that which is the more excellent to the
                loved one. Anything less, when the word love is uttered
                is a travesty. For less; denigrates it's meaning.
                Violating the inborn commitment and loyalty which lies
                at the very core of the spoken words; "I love you. </p>
              <p>The key words in the above are; "the giving of
                oneself." The giving of the best of oneself to the loved
                one. We are not talking about giving the crumbs or the
                left overs, the scraps. But the giving of the more
                excellent. Which one has to give. </p>
              <p>Any thought word or deed that hinders, or blocks, or
                takes away from another, or from oneself their chance to
                grow and evolve bastardizes love. </p>
              <div>If we destroy instead of engendering another or our
                own self-worth. We are takers instead of "givers of
                light". We are to breathe life into, not take it away
                but to achieve this; we must have a working definition,
                a definitive working definition of "who" and "what" we
                are? And a definitive definition of life and its'
                meaning. We should have asked of ourselves somewhere
                along the way about the quality of our living, of our
                being, of our loving? Also whether we are takers or
                givers? Givers of truth, love and life. </div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>The last word; one cannot "Love" while&nbsp;in the
                same breath of professing said love, be expecting
                anything. A reward, a gift or a return of love.&nbsp; To
                repeat; love is not a taker but a giver.&nbsp; No
                strings attached.</div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>One of the hardest affirmations to get someone to
                admit to in a counseling session is; "I am responsible
                for my life." I am responsible for the nurturing, the
                growth and the evolution of my life. I am responsible
                for the choice of my words, thoughts and actions. I am
                just plain responsible for my life. </div>
              <p>"All" are responsible within this given unitize system
                of time and space, on this spinning globe. To share in
                the creating of the most conducive, engendering
                conditions for the collective mind, body and spirit for
                all of humanity and for all of creation. </p>
              <p>The good, better, and the more excellent in whatever
                fields of endeavor, be they of hand, mind or spirit,
                needs to be the criteria. Anything less denies the
                excellence of that which has been created for our use
                and benefit. For we are the inheritors of the excellence
                of "All and Everything." But even greater than this, we
                are by birthright, the "image" of the Ineffable, the
                Author of "All and Everything. </p>
              <p>It is true, we cannot demand excellence in thought,
                word and deed from others. But we can surely ask,
                invite, implore, suggest, inquire, motivate, persuade,
                influence, inspire, stimulate, encourage, and cajole,
                everyone we may cross paths with, if at all possible. We
                need to remember that more is "caught than taught". </p>
              <p>We also need to remind ourselves that life is for the
                living, for those who are aware and alive to the
                possibilities and the potentialities of all of life. For
                those, who are especially aware of all the given gifts
                and graces that have been so graciously given for our
                growth and evolution. So we might return back if we so
                choose; back from whence we came. And the "dead must
                bury the dead". While at the same time prevent the dead
                from burying the living. </p>
              <p>We only penalize ourselves if we accept indolence and
                inert-ness; while living among the "hollow people" and
                embracing mediocrity. Everyone has the possibility to
                run towards the light, to escape the darkness. To seek
                out the aware, the alive, those who are becoming and
                being what they were created to be. To run towards those
                things that promote, engender and celebrate, the
                positive possibilities of life. To join with those who
                are the givers of light. Those who are the living
                definition of en-lighten-ment. Those who are and have
                become that which they have always been, "Infinity". The
                "All in All".</p>
              <p>How strange it is that we ignore the mandate, as though
                it was never spoken; "Be as Your Creator. Be as your
                Creator, how? Is this possible? Yes! How? Never stop
                seeking or asking. Never stop becoming and being what
                you were created to be. If you will do these things,
                with all your mind, heart and strength. The possibility
                can be yours. Why? </p>
            </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Because you are made in the
                Supreme Substance. Could we ask for anything more? Than
                to be "in and of" the Image of Absolute Love, of the
                Beingness of Being. The term is not important for there
                are no descriptive words for the "Ineffable". What is
                important, is that we define this "Absolute Love" by
                expressing through thought, word and deed. That we are
                "in and out of" this Absolute, for we are one and the
                same with the " I am that I am". </font></p>
