              <p>As with all probing and explorations into the chasms of
                truth. One must continue to dig deeper in between the
                crevices of the Consciousness levels; down deep into the
                'Transcendental <i>Stillness'</i>. As the depth and the
                levels change, so does the materiality of those doing
                the digging.&nbsp;Strangely, they are never the same.
                Plus, there is no turning back. '<i>The die is cast'.</i>

              <p>It is important, that we come to grips with the
                impermanence of life. Life is in flux, change is the
                name of the game. But this should not be such a shock to
                us. All of life is about birth, death and rebirth. About
                change and transformation; the changing of size, shape
                and seasons. Nothing on earth, or in the cosmos stays
                exactly the same. Growth and e-volution (conscious
                energy.) Along with the process of de-volution (creative
                energy) both are in process at the same time. Change is
                the granddaddy of all time. Life is a constant
                metamorphosis of motion and energy, generated by <b>Will</b>.
                The 'Alpha and the Omega'. </p>
              <p>Since the physical manifestations of '<i>all and
                  everything'</i> are in constant flux and change. And
                transformations are a second by second "happening." What
                say we about the mind, body and spirit of the human
                species. Do they escape this eternal process of
                transformation? </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <div align="center">
                <img alt="feather" src="../images/feather.gif"
                  border="0" width="65" height="23"></div>
              <p>Speculation for speculation sake is a '<i>no exit'</i>
                when it comes to the areas of the metaphysics, religion,
                or the Spiritual realm. It solves nothing, answers
                little. It might well be referred to as "mental
                masturbation". Even though it may make for a pleasant
                evenings' interlude for discussion sake. Let's face it -
                if we are discussing the intangibles, abstract
                formulations, philosophical inquires, the ineffable ,or
                the reality of the <i>Reality</i>. We are 'whistling in
                the dark'. These things cannot be perceived by pure
                intellection. Nor, can the rubrics of conceptualization
                do them justice. Partially, because consensual language
                betrays them. </p>
              <p>Knowledge of, the understanding of the ineffable of
                Life comes about, by experiencing the "<i>is-ness</i>"
                the " <i>thus-ness"</i> of these things. Call the
                simile; via " <i>awakening"</i>, being aware and alive
                to the "<i>nowness"</i> of that which is being
                experience. To become aware, awakened, and alive to the
                moment, allows us to see reality as <i>Reality</i>,
                during the quickening. <i>Reality</i> cannot be created
                or destroyed. <i>Reality</i> is neither permanent or
                impermanent. It just is THAT which just IS. It has no
                beginning, no end. It has been recorded as the Alpha and
                the Omega, one and the same. The All in All. </p>
              <p>Reality is not concepts, creeds, duality's,
                dichotomies, categories, classifications, models and
                modalities, conditions or non-conditions, or cause and
                effect. It just IS. </p>
              <p>The sooner we work through all this, and come to know,
                understand and BE... Reality. Be our "Ultimate Nature".
                We will experience, become and know, that we are one
                with <i>All and Everything</i> and with the ALL IN ALL.
                It is in this being and doing that we will know; Who,
                Why and What we are? And always have been. </p>

              <p>Technology, materialism, consumerism, industrialism, or
                whatever <i>ism</i> which comes front and center. Are
                not inherently negative, destructive, dehumanizing,
                de-selfing or demoralizing. They are amoral. But of
                course, they can become all these and more, via human
                choices and endeavors. As human beings; we can moderate
                and balance any and all manifestations. Never, never are
                we to allow the externals to be the controlling factors
                in life. Things cannot be allowed in the saddle to ride
                us. It must be the other way around. To help in this
                dilemma. It wouldn't be a bad idea, if we would find
                out, just who and what we are? And what we are to be
                about? If these questions can be answered; we can become
                and be the answers, we find. Then we will KNOW THAT, WE
                KNOW. When this happens all the questions will cease. </p>

              <p>There have been those times in my life, when I just
                wanted to grab a particular person and shake them until
                their teeth rattled. For it is so disheartening to watch
                a person who is just sleep-walking through life.
                Especially those who have so much going for themselves
                but have accepted&nbsp;less. What a waste! Sort, of like
                fallen fruit on the ground, that eventually spoils.
                Unless someone intervenes and rescues it from where it
                has fallen. </p>

              <p>To accept defeat, as being permanent, is to forfeit
                one's courage. To have a defeatists' attitude, also
                forfeits life; leaving one to live in the arid
                wastelands of deprivation. Let's put it another way; if
                we accept any condition, or symptoms that block the
                well-being, the growth and e-volution towards wholeness
                as a final reality; as the way things are, we lie down
                with the '<i>wastelanders'</i>. Those who live in the
                shadows. The vacuous people who appear to be living,
                although their pallor belies the fact. </p>

              <p>Empty lives seek substitutes, as do painful lives. And
                to&nbsp;many times with little or no regard as to the
                consequences to self or others. What they want is all
                that counts. Disregarding any and all rules (ground
                rules) for momentary fleeting fixes to make up for the
                meaninglessness of their lives Or to soothe feelings of
                boredom, worry, fear, anxieties and guilt.&nbsp;Out
                of&nbsp;this process of de-selfing, they become as T.S.
                Eillot so aptly described; '<i>the hollow people'</i>.
                Or, as I have refer to them; the surface people, who
                flit here, there and everywhere. As this&nbsp;erosion
                sets in. They are liken to skipping stones across the
                waters' surface. But as the energy thrust diminishes,
                they sink deeper and deeper into their watery graves. </p>

              <p>How we posture&nbsp;our affirmations or injunctions is
                important. Case in point; human beings can transcend
                those tendencies that negate their humanness, how?&nbsp;
                Do not believe that you are only your mind, body,
                emotions or feelings. You are more, much more. You come
                from beyond, your humanness. You are of the Divine.
                Image of the Image (&nbsp;in kind and in likeness). Of
                like substance. The divine merging with the Divinity.
                One and the same. </p>
              <p>And from these frames of references, these
                affirmations, this being of Being. You will remember who
                and what you are and return back to " THAT " which just
                " IS. " One with the <i>ALL IN ALL</i> </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <img alt="feather" src="../images/feather.gif"
                  border="0" width="65" height="23"></div>
              <p>In all my writings, discussions, statements or
                affirmations. I, at no time have meant them to be
                argumentative, demanding, condescending or patronizing.
                I wish them to be dialectic; if need be challenging,
                empowering, enhancing and motivational. They
                are&nbsp;but benchmarks, searchlights, suggestions,
                options, alternatives and reference points. They
                are&nbsp;insights, reflections and points of Being. I
                would certainty agree that they are intents&nbsp;
                with&nbsp;a great deal of&nbsp;intensity&nbsp;behind
                them. There is no doubt that my enthusiasm has no
                bounds. And at times, I have to sit on it. With
                certainty; I want what I write, or say to point beyond
                the intent and the word. To point to other possibilities
                and paradigms. For it is the spirit, not the letter, or
                the symbol that is important. </p>
              <p>My disclosures are of a experiential nature, coupled
                with insights&nbsp;which I have gathered along the way.
                Truths and values that has been proven to be so, {for
                me} up to this point in time and space. And hopefully
                there is more in store for me, just around the corner,
                or over the next horizon. </p>
              <p>There is a need as one scripts their life, to pencil in
                as many experiences as is possible. It is the
                experiencing of the '<i>all and everything'</i> while at
                the same time internalizing the thus-ness of each <i>now
                </i>that allows the gift of awareness to surface. As we
                enter into the flow of life, life will tutor us if we
                can acquire the art of seeing and hearing, the lessons
                that are being re-presented over and over again. </p>
              <p>If there is a continuity of growth and evolution, a
                sense of stability, along with a balance and harmony.
                And all systems are performing at peak level. One should
                go for it. We have only so many breaths to breathe, so
                many hours to live (about 650,000).before we stop
                functioning. Life is precious,this you need to learn and
                appreciate.&nbsp; And if things are not going to
                well.&nbsp; One needs to reflect and reprogram.</p>
              <p>If a persons' perceptions, or structured reality causes
                one's thoughts, words and deeds to be out of "sync".
                Leaving one in a state of&nbsp;' quiet desperation'.
                Then the time has come for a personal
                evaluation,&nbsp;an assessment of ones' priorities and
                choices that are being made. Along, with a check-up, of
                one's value system. </p>
              <p>If ones' life has become dysfunctional, with more <i>downs</i>
                than <i>ups</i>. Then repair is called for, a
                re-tooling, a re-defining. So that a sense of "Well
                Being" can come front and center. To replace the
                dis-ease. </p>
              <p>There are many methodologies to well-ness. But, like
                Truth, Beauty, Goodness or Love. The secret lies in
                entering into the flow, the energy, the spirit of that
                which you choose and do. Method is hollow,&nbsp;becoming
                and being is the nexus. So wellness can become embedded
                within. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <div align="center">
                <img alt="feather" src="../images/feather.gif"
                  border="0" width="65" height="23"></div>
              <p>Things in and of themselves have little or&nbsp;no
                value. True or false? We decide what value to give
                things. Yes!&nbsp;Everybody has their own rating
                practices as to what is valuable or as to&nbsp;what is
                not valuable in their life. At the top of some peoples'
                list we might find such things; as status, position,
                power, wealth or even fame. As with others, we see them
                giving value, importance to security and the
                accumulation of those things that promote and give some
                assurance to this wanted security. </p>
              <p>In all we have mentioned so far, there is always that
                danger of&nbsp;becoming possessed by our wishes and our
                possessions. As they become an end all to end all. Now
                one does not have to be a member of the "Mesa Society"
                to figure out that all these are temporal and&nbsp;can
                be taken away in a blink of an eye. In light of this; we
                need to ask ourselves, what happens then, how do we
                survive, how do we cope? What resources can we fall back
                on? </p>
              <p>But better still, we need to ask ourselves; are all
                these things just a substitute for what we really want?.
                Do we acquire because we are seeking or wanting a
                feeling of security? Do we acquire because of our
                persistent loneliness, our need for a sense of
                belonging, to be accepted, to be loved. What is our
                intent, what is behind our motivations for the
                acquisition of things? </p>
              <p>We started this discussion, by saying that things,
                animate or inanimate have only the value we place or
                give to them. This is partially correct as it relates to
                our own structuring of reality. But things in an of
                themselves have their own "is-ness," their "thus-ness."
                One of our most grievous faults, is we do not see that
                which just is, for what it is.. We are more prone to see
                only what we want to see, we conveniently wear a variety
                of tinted shades. Plus the fact we create the many
                images, we hold to be real and of value. </p>
              <p>We hinted that sometimes we seek out substitutes to
                help in our loneliness and emptiness. To help in our
                lack of feeling secure. Or in our needs of acceptance,
                belonging and being loved. Most of us are aware of the
                growing child, who does many things to gain the
                attention of others. To be noticed in a way feeds even
                though falsely, a sense of identify. Giving a quick fix;
                but this quick mend does not last, so it sends one off
                looking for a new fix and a new fix, on and on. </p>
              <p>When discussing the values, we have set on various
                things, too often there is no mention of the fact as to
                how a certain&nbsp;value came into being. Who set it and
                why? What was the motivation behind it. We have all
                heard the phrase;" Which came first, the chicken or the
                egg?" Out of the many possessions we have accumulated.
                We need to ask; has the price tag been set by society?
                Or did we increase the value after purchase? </p>
              <p>To many times we give a value to something, then
                acquire and possess it. And then identify and attach
                ourselves to those things&nbsp;which we have given a
                value too. And then continually keep raising the value
                and the acquiring. Sort of a self-fulfilling pricing.
                All this in the hope that our emptiness and loneliness
                will cease to be. </p>
              <p>Here comes the commercial. As a popular comedian used
                to say; "Here comes the judge". True values cannot be
                created nor can there be a substitute for them. </p>
              <p>The sad part of this entire scenario we have so
                cleverly created in giving values to so many
                things&nbsp;which have little or no value. Is we have
                forgotten we are the price fixers,&nbsp;we are
                responsible for this "House of cards." </p>
              ../../
              <p>If we can become aware of this absurdity of how we have
                placed, or overvalued so many things. And the
                significance, the importance we have established in
                regards to owning, accumulating and the possessing of
                things. To the point they have us, instead of we having
                them.&nbsp; We are at the beginning of understanding how
                we create the world we have chosen to live in. If we
                have programmed the "absurdities" the "false", we can
                delete and re-program the "Real".</p>
              <p>We have become attached, addicted and controlled by;
                the very things we have given life too, by the value an
                importance we have given to them. All this becomes a
                vicious circle. </p>
              <p>How many of the&nbsp;young and old cannot get out from
                under the burden, the control and limiting freedom,
                created by these things. These very things we have
                breathed life into. Giving them the power to influence
                whether we will join the living or the dead. </p>
              <p>What has been said up to now could as&nbsp;well apply
                to our relationships. Our beliefs, customs, and
                traditions. Our ideas and thoughts; also to all our
                myths and superstitions. All these which we have given a
                price tag too. We have given each and everything our
                evaluation. Much like we classify, categorize and
                catalogue everything. Believing in doing so, we know
                what it is. If we can name it our fears are minimized.
                If we can price it, attach a value to it even if it is
                false. We feel less empty, less lonely. We are talking
                about temporary "Band-Aids". </p>
              <p>We have said it before in many different ways. And I
                feel certain these words will be repeated many times
                more. What ever we describe, is not that which is. Why?
                Because we see only in part, not as it is. Our thinking
                is fragmentary, incomplete, not "Whole". It is like
                trying to see the contents of a room by peeking through
                the keyhole. Or understanding an author and his thesis,
                by reading a few lines of a review on the jacket of his
                book. Or being aware of the moment while living in the
                past or the future. </p>
              <p>If we can come to understand this, we just might, find
                out; "who and what" we really are. </p>
