          <td valign="middle" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial">Somewhere
              in my wanderings, my walk through life and thought. The
              ancient words; " I am that I am" have surfaced from time
              to time. But now, in the twilight "October" steps of my
              life. These words are on my lips and in my heart. They
              have taken on my flesh, becoming part of my mind, body and
              spirit. In past writings and in small and large
              gatherings, I now, give a viable interpretation to be
              considered. To enhance the hearers', possible growth and
              evolution. "I am that I am" i.e., I am known by that which
              I have proven to be so,for me.
              <p>Whenever this time honored affirmation has appeared in
                my meditation, or been spoken. Momentarily I want to
                substitute the words; " Who or What? "in place of the
                word "that" i.e. "I am who I am" or "I am what I am".
                Not on a permanent basis by any means but simply to
                introduce a preface to expand the in-sight. "I am who
                and what I am, I am that which I think, I am that which
                I speak, I am that which I do. Of course these are but
                relative assessments; they are not "Reality". For I am
                not 'this' or 'that'. For I am "already" <strong>{I
                  just is}</strong> and always have been. And until we
                can affirmatively answer this eternal question, as to
                who and what we are? We will continue to be but
                wanderers; former residents of another time and space.
                For ever wondering why? And asking; 'is this all there
                is'? </p>
              <p>It is important for those, the hearers of the words; "
                I am that I am". To seek out and ask the meaning, the
                intent of these words for their lives. And it is also
                essential that this seeking and asking be ceaseless;
                until these cryptic words reveal their secret. And
                should by chance someone ask; " How long will this
                search take? " Answer: It will take as long as it is
                necessary to take. For some, it is a sudden awakening,
                for others the search is more arduous. Some chew and
                assimilate faster than others,for many reasons. We have
                the milk drinkers and the meat eaters. </p>
              <p>The journey through life is uncertain for many.
                Directions and destinations become confusing and
                non-important at times for them. As feelings of
                lost-ness surface, accompanied by a malaise and a
                depressing boredom, which enters in, embracing the mind,
                body and spirit. Holding them prisoners; as the light
                starts receding and the shadows lengthen, taking on a
                reality of their own. In this diminishing light, life
                begins its' walk among the shadows of the wastelands.
                Much like the lives of those 'cave-dwellers' in Plato's
                walled scenario. Where the Unreal was mistaken for the
                Real. </p>
              <p>If I recall correctly, a story is told; that when
                Buddha was asked the question; " What are you?" His
                reply was; " I am aware. " In the case of Christ, the
                word, " Who " was substituted for the rhetorical "What?"
                When he ask of his disciples, " Who do you say that I
                am? " The reply that came back; " I say, you are the son
                of God." And Christ said;" You also are <strong>sons</strong>
                of God. And <strong>you</strong> will do even greater
                things than I." Could it not be said that each of these
                timely messengers knew, who and what they were and why
                they were here. And where they had come from. Regardless
                of the semantics used or the origins of each of the
                stories. And the interpretation of the time. What say we
                now? " Who and what are we?</p>
              <p>The call, the quest, the challenge is waiting for those
                who want to know their Ultimate Nature, as to who or
                what they were created to be? Along with the fulfilling
                of some of our human needs. Such as our identity, our
                need to belong, be accepted and to be loved. The gifts
                and graces of the quest are beyond count. Of course the
                ultimate test does not lie within our rhetoric or in the
                acquisition of in-sights and the wisdom of life's'
                journey. But rather, how we become and be, the answers
                we have arrived at. The incarnation of the Light and the
                Truth, must take place. And then when we are asked; "Who
                and What, we are? " We can , without hesitation or
                stuttering, say; I know 'I am that I am' without any
                doubt or uncertainty. </p>
              <p>Which is to say; that one has to become the definitive
                definition, of " who and what " they are. The created
                expressed " image, " the likeness of the <strong>Creative
                  Will</strong>, the <strong>Creative Spirit</strong>
                that moved across the Void<em>, the Absolute Body of
                  Love</em>. </p>
              <p>And they will become known by what they have proven to
                be so. They will be that which, <strong>Just is</strong>.
                As are all things above and below. They will be the <strong>very
                  Substance of the very Substance</strong>, one and the
                same. For they are part of the Eternal Cycle, i.e., the
                de-volution and the evolution of " all and everything. "
                They will returned back knowingly out of a conscious
                decision and effort. </p>
              <p><strong>Paradise Lost</strong> has always been within,
                buried, forgotten at times but never-the-less just a
                breath away. The triad keys to open the door of the
                paradise paradigm; are to seek, ask and knock. Until the
                door of <strong>Reality</strong> opens. Seek without
                ceasing, ask the right questions and knock until the
                door is opened. </p>
              <p>If one doubts their ability, their potentially, their
                possibilities and the <strong>Power</strong> that
                stands waiting to be acknowledged; then one needs to
                self-remember their origins, as to " Who and What. "
                they are. Those beginnings before time and space became
                their prison. </p>
              <p>The eternal question of our True Nature needs to be
                answered and can be answered, if we choose it to be so.
                We live or perish by the choices we make or fail to
                make. As is said in the game of basketball. The ball is
                in your court. What are you going to do? Play or pass,
                Yes or no? </p>
              <p>Let's continue along the same line of inquiry. Saying
                much the same, but with a different spin, a variation.
                We briefly mentioned an affirmation made by Buddha in a
                reply to a question addressed to him; "What are you?"
                And his choice of words; "I am aware". And we ask, aware
                of what? What does it mean to be aware? </p>
              <p>I am reminded of an ancient story which spoke about the
                importance of "centering", becoming "single- minded,
                focused and aware". The need for bare attention. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>One day, a Zen master was approached and
                asked; if he would please write down some in-sights,
                some words of the highest wisdom.
                <p>The master took brush in hand and wrote in broad
                  strokes. The word <strong>Attention!</strong></p>
                <p>Is that all, asked the person. Will you not add
                  something else?</p>
                <p>The master then wrote two words in succession. <strong>Attention!,
                    Attention!</strong></p>
                <p>Well, remarked the person rather indignantly. I see
                  very little discernment in what you have just written.
                  Please give me something more.</p>
                <p>The master, brush in hand wrote the same word, three
                  times; <strong>Attention!, Attention!, Attention!</strong></p>
                <p>By now the person half angered, demanded, "what does
                  that word attention, mean anyway"?</p>
                <p>And the master answered ever so gently. <br>
                  Attention means <strong>Attention</strong>. </p>
              </blockquote>
              Awareness means being aware of <strong>awareness</strong>.
              What does it mean to be aware? What does it entail? Let's
              begin by saying what awareness is not. If I say someone is
              unaware of who she or he is and unaware of the world, they
              live in, and the people and the things of the world. Then
              this is not awareness. This is not being aware. The
              ancients called this unawareness, as being asleep. And
              that one needs to awaken to "all and everything".
              <p>Awareness walks hand in hand, with another pro-active
                word, <strong>alive-ness</strong>. If we see a person
                walking around just to save funeral expenses. We can be
                sure that both awareness and alive-ness have fled the
                scene. Awareness and alive-ness are inter-active and
                part of the ways, means and instruments for our growth
                and evolution towards; a wholeness, a self-rightness
                that comes from the <strong>Original Intent</strong>,
                the <strong>Creational Intent</strong>. Where the
                Intent was willed, imaged into being. Where life was
                breathed, the Vital breath out of the 'Image of the
                Will'. Or to say it another way; the Image of the Will
                was breathed into Being, then and now. </p>
              <p>Again we ask; what is this thing called "Aware-ness"?
                For some the answer to be aware mean to be awake; to
                see, hear, to know, to understand, to become, to be, to
                be alive to the moment, the "Now". To live neither in
                the past or the future. But to become and be the past
                and the future by being the incarnation of the "Now". As
                one steps into the light of <strong>Light</strong>. And
                shuns the darkness, the unreal, the false, the negative.
                Becoming the 'giver of light' dispelling the shadows, so
                that the brilliance of the day can be seen and
                appreciated. </p>
              <div>Awareness taken to it's final conclusion, brings a
                sense of the all-knowing. And one can say; " I am that I
                am. " And consciously know that they know. Both of these
                evolutionary statements come out of an experiential
                pilgrimage, via a variety of paradigms and levels of
                consciousness. A pilgrimage underlined through out by an
                intentional grounding, a centering , a focusing around
                two pivotal needed instruments; <em>contemplation and
                  meditation</em>. </div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>The words; "Be still and know" are as valid today as
                they were, sixty-one years ago. When I knew and
                understood their meaning for me.. For my survival
                against the darkness of the night, with its' shadows and
                words that were less than human. As I listened through
                the paper thin walls, that separated me from the
                nightmare, that was going on in the next room.</div>
              <p>This awareness of which we speak, this knowing quality
                gives us the keys to open the "doors of perception."
                Allowing us to see, to hear, to touch, to taste and
                smell, the realities of the moment, as to their Is-ness
                and Thus-ness. It also allows us to observe, watch and
                witness ourselves in thought and action, as subject and
                object. To stand outside ourselves and look within and
                hear the echoes of the Eternal Void, out of which we
                came. And to watch ourselves as we view the world,
                people and the things of the world. A sort of viewing
                ourselves viewing. </p>
              <p>This approach to the verities of Truth is age old,
                reaching back to the oral traditions. Which each new
                generation passes on to each in coming generation. As
                their attempts to answer the "Why and Wherefore" of
                human existence. The truths about our <strong>Being</strong>,
                our <strong>Ultimate Nature</strong> are found in every
                major and minor religion. In the myths and mythologies
                of the past and present civilizations. Also in the many
                esoteric disciplines since time immemorial These
                energies, these impressions that have arisen from these
                and other sources, have become the food , the "meat" for
                those who have become aware and alive to these energy
                bytes. This <strong>Ineffable Power</strong> that
                pervades and permeates "<em>All and Everything</em>",
                below and above. Has given expression to these words; "
                I have meat to eat that you do not know of. </p>
              <p>We have said it before and will keep on saying it. In
                one way or another, the <strong>Ineffable</strong>
                defies description by our analytical linear sequential
                thought patterns. But this in no way precludes nor
                eliminates our possibility to know that we know, the <strong>Ultimate
                  Reality</strong>. The sum total of the "<em>all and
                  everything</em>" of the "<strong>All and Everything,
                  the All in All</strong>." And though we may never be
                able to adequately communicate the <em>Unutterable</em>,
                the <em>Indescribable</em>, the <em>Infinite</em>,
                that which just <strong>IS</strong>.. Never-the-less,
                we can know we know. </p>
              <blockquote><strong><u>HOW?</u></strong></blockquote>
              By becoming and being that <strong>Image</strong> which
              is out of the reflection and is the reflection of the <strong>All
                and Everything</strong>. Out of which "all and
              everything " has its' very being, its thus-ness. For we,
              as with all things, " above and below " have been
              imprinted with the Image, the Imago Deo. The <strong>Expressed
                Image</strong> of the <strong>Image Maker</strong>. We
              are the extension of the Original Intent, i.e. <strong>The
                Will</strong>. We are family, part of the unitive
              system. Which serves and is served.
              <p>When one experiences, becomes and is the expressed
                image of the original intent, i.e., the will. Then he or
                she will know and know, they know. Who and what, they
                are. For then face to face, they will mirror <strong>Image</strong>
                the <strong>Image</strong>, the likeness. And become
                one and the same with the <strong>Creative Spirit</strong>.
                As it was in the beginning and shall be ever more. </p>
              <p>As the many seeds are nurtured and exposed to our
                developing perceptivity and growing consciousness. It is
                important that we do not mistaken the bloom as an end
                evolution. As beautiful as the bloom may appear to be.
                For the bloom is but a prelude for the fruit to come.
                Which we need to take and eat, for the nourishment of
                our bodies, mind and spirit. So that we might grow into,
                becoming and being that which we were imaged to be,
                since the beginning. </p>
              <p>We have been skirting and inadvertently speaking about
                a paradigm shift, a dimensional leap which differs from
                our time space continuum. But for the moment let us
                speak about our consensual time construct by which we
                measure and run our lives on. We have accepted our
                present paradigm of time and space. As we accepted that
                the World was flat at one time and that the Earth was at
                the center of the, then known Universe. And as then, we
                still choose to limit our vision and materiality. As
                well as the levels of our consciousness. We are by all
                intent and purpose locked into this sequential time
                system, probably for survival reasons. But for whatever
                the reasons. To change the restrictions of time, this
                lock it has on us, we must change the constitutionally
                of our bodies and minds. By materializing the light
                within. Becoming and being the Light. (en-lighten-ment)
              </p>
              <p>It is curious indeed that we find ourselves so caught
                up in this mystery, we call time. Since our origins, our
                beginnings came out of the <strong>VOID</strong>, the <strong>Creational
                  Womb</strong>, the timeless body of love. Where the
                terms; time,finite and infinite were useless. No
                duration, no sequential time patterns, a past or a
                future, no cause and effect. More of a neutralization, a
                timelessness, a void, a completeness, a wholeness
                (holiness), and an at-one-ment. </p>
              <p>The Creational Intent, i.e. <strong>The Will</strong>,
                places us momentarily in the World, but by Intent, we
                are not of it. Because we have had our beginnings, our
                birth in and of the Image, as <strong>The Void</strong>
                reflected it. But before our Expressed Image was
                reflected and our descent was inevitable. The <strong>Creative
                  Will</strong> gave birth to an infinite number of
                cyclic impressions, forms, appearances and reflections
                to prepare, for Humanity's' descent down into the World.
                Into the dimensions of time, a new materiality. Where
                the Micro meets the Macro, each penetrating one another.
                But hidden within this process, this downward
                progression were the beginning seeds of what would or
                could be the possibility for our ascension, our upward
                thrust, our return back. Our conscious return back to "
                Paradise Lost ", our beginnings </p>
              <p>"All and everything" was prepared for us to regain our
                heritage the " who and what, "we were imaged to be. So
                that if we would so choose and make the conscious effort
                to do that which is necessary. We would have the
                possibility to grow and evolve; to ascend back from
                whence we came. And know, we know " Who and What " we
                were and are. That which escaped us in that Divine
                moment of our Infinite Conception. Because we did not
                know that we knew. In this case, bliss was indeed
                ignorance. </p>
              <p>De-ascension or the de-evolution or as is said by some;
                "The Fall" was out of a necessity. No descension, no
                ascension, no darkness, no light, no yang, no yin. As
                the song goes; you can't have one without the other.
                Without the descent you and I would not have one of our
                greatest gifts; <em><u>the free will to choose</u></em>.
                Nor would there have been the gifts of awareness,
                alive-ness and thanksgiving. So that we might know who
                and what we are and why? And be thankful that we know,
                we know. </p>
              <p>Let's say, we were conceived and placed in a sanctuary
                of perfection. Where everything that could possibly be
                needed for comfort and well-being was provided. A place
                where strife and conflict were non-existent. No tears,
                no fears, no sorrows, only joy. A place of peace and
                harmony, a true Shangra-la. A virtual paradise, a
                wonderland of opulence, ours forever and ever. </p>
              <p>How would we know and appreciate that which we had? If
                there were no differences, no distinctions between this
                and that, no levels of discernment, no contrasts, no
                knowing? How does one know perfection, if one is
                conceived in perfection? How would we know there was
                darkness if there was no light? Or beauty, or good, or
                truth, or love without each of their opposites? </p>
              <p>There is a story about a wealthy King, who lived in a
                beautiful castle. A palace that was known throughout the
                land, A palace that had no equal in beauty and elegance.
                But the King of this castle, who had all the riches he
                needed, lived in the dungeon, in a small room beneath
                the castle. A damp shabby cell of rags and rubbish which
                he called his possessions. All his ministers of state,
                visited him regularly. And tried to explain to him that
                he was the King, and that he should return to his
                stately quarters and give up his shabby existence. But
                he insisted that they were all mad and deluded. And that
                he would not leave all his treasures. </p>
              <p>Let us for a moment, look at that psychological
                phenomenon, known as amnesia. Where one becomes
                separated from his identity and his memories. Where he
                cannot remember any of his experiences, dreams,
                aspirations or goals. Or in some cases the families, all
                those things that speak of " who and what " they are,
                where one belongs. A life, where the slate is wiped
                clean, all tapes and scripts erased. All the parental,
                societal and cultural programming deleted. Leaving a
                person less than they were, a zero. Not to remember, to
                know, to understand what has happened. To be separated
                from that which was. To see this happen, is heart
                rendering. </p>
              <p>I do not want to stretch this amnesia analogy to thin,
                but I am confident that one can see, that there is a
                concurrent parallel, a close similarity as to our
                separation. As to " who and what we really are, as to
                our <strong>Absolute Nature</strong>. For we too, have
                forgotten our connective-ness, our heritage, our wealth.
                As with the amnesia patient, there is that sense of
                urgency to regain his connective-ness with his past, so
                it is with us. And in our regaining of what we have
                lost, for so long. We need to regain our senses and our
                identity, as does the amnesia patient. </p>
              <p>There are many consensual systems that proffer various
                ways, means and instruments for our return back and for
                our en-light-ment and at-one-ment. It would seem
                ludicrous and inane to believe, to assume that there is
                but one of these consensual methodologies that can speak
                of 'all the truth and nothing but the truth'. </p>
              <p>Our attempts to speak about the <strong>Ineffable</strong>,
                are just that, attempts. Our human language; our usual
                two dimensional posturing, along with our biases and
                pre-suppositions, are not the best search tools for
                reaching out beyond our human nature. We need a new
                language, a new paradigm, a different process. If we are
                to go beyond the edges of the our envelopes and enter
                into the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh dimensions of
                becoming and being. So we can walk up and down, in and
                out of this process of growth and evolution. And we need
                to get started, as soon as possible. </p>
              <p>How does one find this different paradigm, this ongoing
                process? Once again, we must seek after without ceasing.
                Seek after what? </p>
              <div>The meaning <br>
                Of Life, <br>
                Of Truth, <br>
                Of Goodness, <br>
                Of Beauty, <br>
                Of Love, <br>
                Of Justice, <br>
                Of freedom, <br>
                Of wisdom, <br>
                And <br>
                Compassion. <br>
              </div>
              <div>Once the search is started, it does not end, until
                that which is being searched for is found. How does one
                know what they are looking for. The search itself guides
                the seeker. It engenders, motivates, enhances,
                energizes, affirms and celebrates the process of growth
                and evolution (ascension). </div>
              <p>How does one do this seeking? </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>With all their mind, body and spirit. <br>
                With a burning single-mindedness. <br>
                A self-discipline and a determination. <br>
                Along with the right choice of the more excellent. <br>
                To accomplish the task.</blockquote>
              And when it is found, what does one do then? One needs to
              become and be that which is found. If truth is found then
              one needs to become and be that truth. What ever truth,
              value or wisdom. one finds. One must become and be the
              definitive definition of that which is found.
