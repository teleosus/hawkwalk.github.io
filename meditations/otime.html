              paradox of the way, or the path, is that there is no path,
              no way. When anything (thought, word, opinion, creed,
              dogma, method, ritual) is chiseled in stone or
              concertized. It is no longer what it was. It has lost its'
              purity, it's is-ness, its' spirit.
              <p>One of humanity's' most glaring flaws is its'
                propensity to organize all and everything. We seem
                uneasy, until we categorize, classify and catalogue
                everything. Sadly, we believe by defining it, we are in
                control. When in fact, we become limited and constricted
                by this practice. </p>
              <p>This is evident, when we capitalize both the Path and
                the Way, or emphasize by saying; The Path, The Way. Now,
                this will not get you drummed out of the human race. But
                it does infer that we have mistaken the method for the
                process. Here comes heresy! There are many paths, many
                ways, but that, is all they are. If we should make the
                mistake of falling down and worshiping them, as an end,
                in and of themselves. We will be none the wiser. If one
                knows the difference, one can say the path, the way and
                capitalize them. </p>
              <p>But if asked, if there is a way, a path. A qualifying
                statement needs to be used. So that one does not
                mislead. Case in point; When asked; how do you mediate?
                Do you cease all thoughts? Do you shut out the world? Do
                you use controlled breathing? Do you assume a special
                posture? How long do you meditate? My usual comment is;
                that there are hundreds, maybe thousands of different
                ways to meditate. It is not the method, it is one's
                attitude, one's posturing. How one enters into the state
                of meditation. It is not what one does. It is, who one
                is. </p>

              <p>We are past the time of pacifying ourselves, as we walk
                within our comfort zones. The existing ills of the
                world- at-large will not just go away, or take a walk.
                They are here, whether we acknowledge them or not. </p>
              <p>Our days of silence are over. We the peoples of the
                World must in unison rise up and cry, "enough is
                enough". We will not stand by and watch our world being
                destroyed by greed and self-indulgence, debilitating
                poverty and food insecurity, lack of education and
                unemployment, poor infra-structures, disease and
                pestilence. Or any other de-selfing or de-humanizing
                factors that denies personal worth and self respect, for
                all. </p>
              <p>As Donne` said; "No man is an island unto himself". The
                bell tolls for each of us.</p>
              <p>Our Mother earth is dying and so are many, to many of
                her children. And we as the human species have become
                the destroyers of both the earth and our children. By
                our apathy and indifference. We take and take to the
                point of satiation, as the earth cries and the children
                weep. </p>
              <p>It is strange indeed, that we, after all this time and
                effort, are prone towards our own self- destruction,
                whether it be of an outward or an inward cause. Our
                insistence of being less than we are. Is indeed a
                puzzlement, an eternal paradox. We need to stop, the age
                old head burial ritual. and shake the sand out of our
                ears and eyes and begin to hear and see again. So we can
                take up the challenge of being the best of all our
                potentialities and possibilities. Not only for our own
                health and welfare but for the world-at-large. </p>
              <p>For it is still true, that a better World begins with a
                better you and me. No one can be exempt or become an
                absentee human being. To be a human being. means to be
                human, humane. </p>
              <p>To become and be, all one was created to become and be.
                To expand all the gifts and graces of our human nature,
                so that we might reach out beyond our human nature and
                clothe ourselves in the Light. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <div align="center">
                <img alt="feather" src="../../images/feather.gif"
                  border="0" width="65" height="23"></div>
              <p>From purely a survival point, we cannot live either in
                the past or the future. For all our energies, talents
                and skills, need to be saved for the present. For it is
                the present, which needs our undivided attention,
                decisiveness and conscious effort. If we, the people of
                this world are to survive the poverty of our intellect.
                And the perversity of our sometimes irrationality that
                is evident both in our individual and collective lives.
                The "Now" must become important to us. </p>
              <p>For in reality, the "Now" is all we have for sure. The
                pen, paper or plate may drop and the breath ceases. The
                past is past, the future is problematic, never a
                certainty. For tomorrow may never be ours or even the
                next second. </p>
              <p>So, if there is something that needs doing. "Now" is
                the time, before the darkness falls. and becomes
                permanent. </p>

              <p>Each day as we step into the flow of time. It is not
                unlike stepping into a lazy stream each day at the same
                spot, that is not the same spot. Why?, because the flow
                disallows sameness, it is never the same. Just as we are
                never the same. Time cannot march in place. What appears
                to be, is not necessarily so. </p>
              <p>There are those changes, we can perceive. But the more
                subtle changes, escape our detection. For in a way,
                change is in the air. As it is with both, the light and
                the darkness and the gravity that surrounds us. </p>
              <p>The same could be said about those daily changes within
                the physiological, psychological and spiritual
                dimensions, of our body, mind and spirit. </p>

              <p>How does one become human?. Or reach beyond the human
                nature? Certainly it is more than being borne, in a
                particular time and space. More than our DNA or RNA or
                our genetic structuring, or our family tree. Or our
                thinking, feeling and doing. </p>
              <p>Does part of our answer lie in the fact, that we even
                ask or question our existence? Or in the fact, that as
                far as we know, we are the only animal that has taken
                many of the gifts of creation and used them to reach
                beyond self and the given environment. Which we have
                done and are still changing. The jury is still out as to
                these changes and their consequences. </p>
              <p>Our posture is wait and see, as we finish our space
                projects and travel. The cloning of human life. Along
                with the Genetic Engineering that will extend life and
                eradicate many of our life threatening diseases. There
                seems to be no end to our search for the beyond, as we
                prepare for deep space. A flight into the face of the
                Ineffable </p>
              <p>But surely we are far more than our creations. And the
                accumulation of our words and deeds. What then are we?
                Who are we? </p>
              <p>The answer to these questions, these eternal questions
                are worth the quest. And for those who have the singular
                passion, the burning desire to seek after, to
                continually search.the answers will come. And they will
                know and be who and what they were meant to be, what
                they were created to be. AND HAVE BEEN but forgotten </p>
              <p>And that day will come, when we will match our outward
                ascension with an inward ascension. And our flight of
                Light, will be our last flight. </p>

              <p>I have looked into the eyes of time and seen the boy
                and the man of years past. Time has shown me the best
                and the worst steps of humanity and also my own.
                Reminding me of our frailties and our Divinity. </p>
              <p>And for this glimpse and others, I am exceedingly
                grateful, for now I know my return has always been
                expected. A return back to that time before time
                existed. that place of many names. Where "will" meets
                WILL, and they are united as One..As the Alpha and the

                who are just existing. Instead of living in the light,

              <p>Our destiny lies not in the stars, but within. The
                answers to the quintessential questions; Who am I?, Why
                am I here?, and Where am I going? Also lies within us.
                All, have been given the necessary gifts and graces, to
                search out the why and wherefore of human existence, the
                meaning of life and ones' ultimate purpose. This
                searching within must be without ceasing, until the
                below and the above are known. And the whisper; "You are
                "That" becomes audible.</p>
              <p>The two time worn mandates; "Know Thyself" and "Unto
                Thyself be true" are wake-up calls. Unless we Become and
                Be, who and what we are. We will live out our lives in
                bankruptcy, in permanent spiritual poverty. The Light
                shines within and without, if we will become and be
                awake and alive. To the reality that we are Spirit out
                of Spirit, which is part of "all and everything." </p>
              <p>We move and have are Being in the Truth. We are the
                expressed Image of the Image, the "I am That I AM". And
                because this is so, we have the possibility to ascend
                and Be that which we were intended, created to Be. To be
                that which just Is.&nbsp;That which already is.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>A Seeker does not limit his or her seeking to just one
                level of seeking. An avid Seeker searches in and out, of

                desire to learn, to know about all manner of things. </p>

              <p>One needs to Become and Be that which is sought after.

              <p>All systems, paradigms, beliefs, creeds, dogmas, ways,
                means and instruments are meant to facilitate growth and
                evolution. In essence they are but static versions of
                the dynamic, ever flowing REALITY. They are but
                re-presentations, symbols of the IS-NESS, that JUST IS.
                They must not become an end, in and of themselves. No

              <p>All and Everything is in process, growing and
                expanding. Changing moment by moment, always in flux. If
                we are to reach our wholeness; we must seek and ask, all
                the way from the cradle to the grave for a path out of
                many paths. So that each may walk back in their own
                particular way. Back from whence we all came. </p>

              <p>I am neither consistent or inconsistent. I am both.
                when the need arises. But in that moment I am aware that
                I am being inconsistent, for that particular 'need to
                be' situation. Or to say it another way; I am consistent
                in my inconsistencies. Continuity is difficult to
                maintain when change is a certainty. One can be
                inconsistent, if they are consistent by WILL... The
                handmaiden to inconsistency is indecisiveness, Which can
                come from a lack of confidence, self-esteem, a lack of
                knowledge, timidity, not liking oneself and the list
                goes on. </p>
              <p>There is a time for diversity and a time for unity. But
                unity is the goal, the gathering of "all and
                everything". But in unity we see diversity, it is all
                around us, in all of Creation. Look at the Human race,
                how diverse it is, or look at Nature. Now, that is
                diversity. But cannot, we see the unity also. </p>
              <p>Or as we look at ourselves, are we not many things to
                many people. To mothers, we are sons. To wives we are
                husbands. To children we are fathers. We are employees
                and employer, lovers and friends, kings or subjects,
                teachers and pupils. Our diverse roles are endless. </p>
              <p>But even so, there is a unity. We may be different
                things to different people but there is only one of us.
                And the unity of these roles and sub-personalities comes
                about when we recognize that we are more than all these
                roles and sub-personalities. That we have a Self that
                can help bring all these diversities together in balance
                and harmony. Like the Conductor of the Philharmonic
                Symphony who brings together all the artists of the
                symphony under one Baton Bringing all the different
                instruments with their different sounds into a
                harmonious blend. The instruments don't look alike,
                don't sound alike, the skilled players don't like alike
                nor do they play alike but under the watchful eye and
                the skillful guidance of the Master Conductor, beauty is
                borne. </p>
              <p>It is no different with human beings; with all their
                strengths and weaknesses, all their talents and skills,
                all their diverse natures, all the different roles, that
                he or she plays. All the various things going on in the
                mental, emotional and spiritual areas. Under the
                leadership and the guidance of our Actualized Self, our
                core self, our intrinsic self. Use your own semantics.
                We, not unlike the players of the symphony need the same
                cohesiveness, the same harmony and balance. </p>

              <p>We need to travel our paths freely, with no malice of
                thought, word and deed. And with an open heart. For as
                we walk, all the myths, symbols and signs are waiting to
                teach. As are the Masters of Rightness. To those who
                have the eyes to see and the ears to hear. The Call <br>

                And wipe the sand from our eyes. And shake the sand out

              <p>How does someone become human? By Becoming and Being
                all they were created to be. And what pray tell, does
                that mean? It means learning how to choose the best, the
                better the more excellent way of thinking, feeling,
                speaking and doing. So that ones' thoughts and feelings
                are in balance and in harmony. And that in all things,
                within or&nbsp;without, we seek out this same balance
                and harmony. </p>
              <p>The underlying purpose in all this, is to gather
                together all our senses (touch, smell, taste, sound,
                vision and psyche), all our levels of consciousness [
                lower, middle and higher] All our desires and wants that
                come out of all our many minor personalities, those
                mini-i's. That come center stage, demanding to be heard
                and sometimes to be followed. </p>
              <p>Out of this synthesizing process, we have the
                beginnings of finding out; who we are?, why we are here?
                And where we are going? And as all this is taking place,
                we have the possibility to bring all things, 'above and
                below', together in unity. (balance and harmony) Unity
                consciousness was and is, the Alpha and the Omega. All
                for one, and one for all. </p>

              <p>Every time we find ourselves using a consensual
                language whatever the tongue, to describe or define the
                nature of things, as they are. Their intrinsic core,
                there "thus-ness". We are more than likely to miss the
                mark. Because of our linear sequential thought patterns,
                which do quite well as long as we stick to the one and
                two dimensional frames of references. But our sequential
                thinking begins to diminish, as we move into the third,
                fourth, fifth and the additional dimensions. Our
                respective languages fail us as we move from the
                vertical and the horizontal into the dimensions of
                depth[space], time and infinity. Only the symbols of
                mathematics, or art and poetry. Seem to be able to reach
                out into depth, time and infinity. </p>
              <p>Once we step out of the first two dimensions, our
                consensual languages become inadequate and ineffective
                in communicating the realities of the additional
                dimensions. Partially because we spend most of our time
                in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Depth, time
                and infinity needs different modalities and paradigms of
                perception, if we are to understand the worlds beyond
                are usual vertical and horizontal thinking. </p>
              <p>We have difficulty in visualizing depth, time and
                infinity and in becoming part of them. All spatial
                dimensions grow out of one another (horizontal,
                vertical, depth, time and infinity). </p>

              <p>We run after happiness, satisfaction, pleasure, sensual
                enjoyment, power, prestige, status, fame, money and
                approval. And we ask; is there any other means of
                motivation besides the above self-interest frames of
                references. Is it possible to divorce, to dis-attach, to
                dis-identify the self interests from self. </p>
              <p>Answer: Yes. </p>
              <p>By doing what we do, the task at hand, for its' own
                sake. Surrendering to the task at hand is necessary
                while keeping ones' ultimate intent in tact. Ones'
                posturing and positioning must shine through each and
                every task; from walking, talking, sitting, eating or
                even in scrubbing the floor. </p>
              <p>We hear the term "menial tasks" with overtones of being
                boring and below ones level. This type of thinking and
                word selection is a matter of posturing. Things should
                not dictate how one feels or does not feel. If a
                persons' mind, body and spirit are in harmony with "all
                and everything", there is no such thing as a menial
                task. </p>
              <p>It is important to be centered and focused, pro-active
                instead of re-active. Knowing, the task and the
                requirements of the specific task. We are talking about
                a "Nowness". Nowness is experienced when one just does
                it. Pro-action is dictated by time, place and
                circumstances Pro-action needs to have that quality of
                spontaneity for the situation at hand. </p>
              <p>We ask; Is this an evolutionary task, an evolutionary
                service, an evolutionary intention, in serving this
                task, this "Now"? Is growth and evolution being served
                for the world, others or for the real self? </p>
              <p>What tasks fit the above requirements? All tasks. What
                is in question is not the tasks themselves, but the
                intent, the motivation, the why of doing a particular
                task. Where is ones' mind, heart and spirit as they
                perform the task, job, the profession, or whatever they
                are doing. </p>

              <p>Don't let somebody else define you. Nor allow anyone to

              <p>One cannot use the same attitude posturing and mind-set
                to solve the problems that caused their problem. The
                phrase "to die daily" in its simplest interpretation,
                means to die, to put to rest those crippling attitudes,
                poor posturing and that mind-set that is either causing
                the problem, or exacerbating it. Solutions need to come
                from new and different options, frames of references,
                posturing, attitudes and mind set. </p>
              <p>Otherwise one will be sentenced to utter futility and
                frustration. Trying to get out of the hole they dug for
                themselves. Some people remove themselves from their
                present surroundings and start anew. This may solve some
                of the problem, but we must remember we have probably
                brought our old habits with us. And if we are the main
                problem of our problems. We need to change the way we
                walk, talk, think and do. A new person needs to be
                borne. And this takes some doing, especially when one
                thinks, they are just fine. </p>

              <p>Only silence can protect the purity of ones'
                experiences. Along with the aliveness, the richness, and
                vividness. Words dilute and steal the freshness and the
                innocence of the moment. </p>
              <p>Verbiage is a poor substitute for reality. Once the
                experience is exposed to the wind of words its' purity
                is violated. It become less than, losing its' "Is-ness.

              <p>It has been said: that in the scale of evolution, the
                human species arrived on the scene a couple of minutes
                just before midnight, placing humanity at the end of the
                evolutionary scale. That we are the capstone of "all and
                everything. </p>
              <p>But there is another scenario; we might have arrived on
                the scene, a couple of minutes just before noon. And we
                ask, what now, What happens in the next twelve hours?
                Can we, man or woman shape and create their own destiny,
                out of all the gifts and graces which have been so
                graciously given. "Are we masters our fate, captains of
                our soul? </p>
              <p>What say you? <br>
                You, who are the benefactor of "all and everything". </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>My responsibility is to give that which I have
                received. Or maybe a better way to say it; my
                responsibility is to reflect as a mirror. Mirrors
                reflect images, they mirror in reverse. The light is
                reflected back allowing one to see themselves
                differently because of the reverse effect. I have said
                elsewhere, that 'more is caught than taught'. What we
                reflect, what we mirror, is more important than what we
                say. </p>
              <p>Therefore, it is important that we ask ourselves; In
                who's or what reflection do we stand.? Am I the
                Expressed Image of the Image that I stand in front of?
                Am I part of it and it part of me? </p>

              <p>If one wishes, desires to become the very best at what
                he or she does or desires after. There is a need to
                focus, to center oneself in and on that which is sought
                after. To understand that mastery of anything takes a
                total commitment to, a consistent determination and
                self-discipline on ones' part. Along with a need for
                right discrimination between the better, the best and
                the more excellent ways, means and instruments, skills
                and techniques that will afford the maximum results
                needed to achieve one's fullest potentialities and
                possibilities, in whatever the choice and or endeavor
                might be. </p>
              <p>I would hasten to add, in using the phrase one's
                fullest potentialities and possibilities, we are not
                limiting these words only to the choice, the effort, the
                goal, or the end product Oh no! One's fullest
                possibility and potentiality must include the
                harmonizing and the balancing of the mind, body, and
                spirit, along with all of one's thoughts, words and
                deeds. If there is to be a wholeness and a "unity
                consciousness" with "all and everything". </p>
              <p>All parts, components, bits and pieces, all sensations,
                feelings, emotions and thoughts are to be brought into
                an integrated effort to the accomplishing of the choice
                or the endeavor we have chosen. </p>
              <p>We are to become and be that which we seek after. But
                at this critical point we need to be in but not totally
                of. By this we mean intensity is fine[ controlled
                intensity].. But it is important for us to remember that
                we our more than our choices, desires, goals,
                objectives, knowledge, wisdom, insights, ways, means,
                instruments, rituals, symbols, thought, words and deeds.
                And of course the finite realities we perceive. </p>

              <p>One can choose to walk one of two paths, one path
                allows us to enjoy the fruits of "all and everything" as
                an end unto itself. The other path leads one to
                experience an expanded consciousness, a "cosmic
                consciousness". The fruits of the expanded conscious,
                the Objective consciousness. are inclusive--- no limits,
                no boundaries. Consciousness at this developmental
                level, outstrips the mere enjoyment of the fruits of all
                Creation, as an end. The Creator consciousness allows
                one to regain their rightful inheritance. An inheritance
                of becoming one with the fruits via the path of
                en-light-ment, which returns the prodigal back to their
                beginnings, their origins, the Void, i.e., The Absolute
                Will, the Absolute Body of love. </p>
              <p>The first path leads to a no- exit, the second path
                reaches beyond the beyond, where there is no beginning,
                no end. For the Alpha and the Omega are one. </p>

              <p>This point in space and time, this, "Now", is like
                trying to grasp the incoming fog that is rolling in to
                sleep with me tonight. </p>
              <p>My thoughts like the shadows from my fire are playing
                hide and seek. The shadows behind the vast stillness of
                the night and my thoughts behind the quiet of my mind. I
                call to my thoughts but they lie in wait, for what, I
                know not. The fog touches me, penetrates me, why will my
                thoughts not come, why do they hide from me? What have I
                done to cause this void? This emptiness? I demand that
                you come from your hiding place. And show yourself, now!
                Do you hear me? </p>
              <p>Suddenly, their in my minds' eye stood this one
                singular demanding thought; "Who and what are you?.
                Answer me that." The question shattered the void, and
                the thoughts came pouring out, out of control. Then
                again the singular thought demanded; "Who and What are
                you?" All clamoring ceased.. </p>
              <p>This thought and I have grown old together, we have
                spend time since my youth. We are old friends., he is
                always with me, even when he is not. He never allows me
                to forget, my search, my looking, my asking. As I walk
                amid the visible and the invisible of my time and space
                odyssey. </p>
              <p>Some times I think I am to close to seeing what I need
                to see. To close to hear what I need to hear. I cannot
                get out of my own way. I am like the fire that cannot
                burn itself, or the sword that cannot cut itself. Or the
                man that cannot find the horse he has lost because he is
                riding it. But strangely I know the answer of who and
                what am I?. But my question is how do I know? </p>
              <p>Trying to retrace my steps, to self-remember how I
                arrived at this point, this "Now, seems implausible, for
                by all logic, I should not be here. The path, my path is
                non-traceable. Like the flight of an arrow, or a bird,
                or the wind. Yet the path is there, visible, yet
                invisible, the same but different for each who seek it
                out. </p>
              <p>I have crawled, walked, stumbled, fallen, and ran.
                Among and with the dead, with the aware and the alive. I
                have been in and out, above and below. in and around
                life, three score and ten plus. In a way I am no closer
                in answering, "who and what am I, or why am I here or
                where am I going?" Than I was when I turned twelve years
                of age. And ask the same questions then. And yet I am. </p>
              <p>My knowing has nothing to do with my linear thought
                processes. I suspect my knowing is intuitive, out of a
                different paradigm, a different modality. An impression
                out of my total seeking and experiencing all these many
                years on earth. An accumulative process of synthesizing
                the "all and everything" of my search, encircled with an
                inordinate passion to know "why?" And upon knowing an
                inordinate gratefulness and thanks giving. </p>
              <p>For me this essence, my intrinsic core has cajoled,
                incited, shamed, enthused, insisted and directed this
                desire, this passion to know the Ineffable, to become
                and be one with. </p>

              <p>Somewhere I read; "We do the possible quickly, the
                impossible takes us just a bit longer." This is a "can
                be," a "can do" posture. We, to often hear; "I could
                have{been}...or might have{been} if only...". As opposed
                to "I can{be} or I will{be}." I hesitate to use the word
                "ideal" because ideals can become exclusive, concreted
                and limiting. So let's use the word "wholeness." If one
                is "whole", together, in communion with "all and
                everything." They are "in the flow" , they are the flow,
                they are not static, or the status quo. They are energy
                in motion. They can do the seemingly impossible at
                times. Because they fail to limit themselves. They "just
                do it".</p>
              <p>For the last forty years of my life, I have in my
                writings, speaking and living. Centered around the
                inquiry of growth and evolution, as it has to do with
                the human psyche. In relation, as to how we see
                ourselves, others, the world and the things of this
                world. Since early on in my life, I have asked, "What's
                it all about, Alfie?" My alter-ego, I have named "Kwah",
                the perennial searcher after. Whose favorite question is
                "Why?." Such as, why do we seemingly accept that the
                accumulated knowledge of the past is sacrosanct, without
                examination, without questioning its' premises. For we
                now know that the earth is not the center of the
                universe, nor is it flat. Where are our heresies today?
                Why are we so taken by the pronouncements of the High
                Priests and Priestesses, along with the Guru's, of the
                Social and Academic Disciplines</p>
              <p>Those who fall in line and follow after, are in the
                most part limiting themselves. Not only does the
                disciple limit himself by&nbsp;holding to but one
                paradigm. He/she limits the teacher at the same time.
                The learner must not become limited or bound to. He/she
                must be free to be aware, to see and to hear. To
                discriminate between the real and the unreal, the true
                and the false. And the light from the darkness. And to
                be always aware that the unreal will forever be trying
                to convince him or her, that it is the "real mcCoy".
                Illusions and delusions are easy to come by. Making the
                unreal become real.</p>
              <p>My, my !, how I do get wound up.</p>
              <p>After saying all that, let's you and I look at some
                hints, some sightings, some perceptions that might be
                considered to be bench marks, lights along the way that
                point to "wholeness". While always keeping in mind that
                the description and the speaker are not the actually.
                The actually is in the becoming and being, of the intent
                of the word. The word "wholeness" is but a word, not the
                reality. There is a need to see into the word
                {in-sight}, around and beyond the word. The word
                attempts to describe, but the word is not the
                description, is not the actuality.&nbsp; Not <strong>That
                </strong>which just is.</p>
              <p>The following are seedlings of in-sight.</p>
              <p>In crisis situations, wholeness demands the ability to
                call together all of ones' strengths, their
                understanding and wisdom to offset any of the imbalance.
                And to restore the needed order and unity.</p>
              <p>Here we might use the Buddhist word, the bringing of a
                "Mindfulness" to the present moment. So as to rise above
                whatever the situation might be. Becoming a gentle
                warrior, if you like, with a strong resolve and intent.
                That results in a decisive pro-action.</p>
              <p>Wholeness calls for a flexibility, to roll with the
                punches. To stay mentally alive and active. To be a
                watcher and observer, that is aware and intent. To be
                aware that worries, fears, and anxieties have little
                relative importance in the light of day. This calls for
                one to be active and discriminate. To be able to
                integrate the less pleasant at times, into the flow of
                life. To always be aware of the unity in diversity.
                Requiring one to be mentally alive, flexible and
                intensive. Which also spells out, the ability to focus,
                to center in on. Without this intent attention "the
                present" slips by us unnoticed and unattended too.
                Usually, because we are preoccupied with the past or the
                future. This "wholeness" of which we speak demands a
                response-ability to the "now". To see things in their
                proper perspective, as to how they relate to the overall
                schema of "all and everything."</p>
              <p>This response-ability has a vital interest in "all and
                everything" It sees all and hears all of the moment. A
                presence with the present. This awareness coupled with
                in-sight, allows the person to know the inner "why" of
                what is going on around him or her. Allowing one at the
                same time" to maintain a balance and a harmony in the
                middle of disorder and disunity. This posits a posture
                of endurance, strength and steadfastness. The ability to
                stand firm in the face of great stress. With a "courage
                to be", to overcome, to rise above life's vicissitudes
                when needed.</p>
              <p>This necessitates the following of an "inner calling".
                Knowing that the right in-sights will be found within at
                the right time. If, the "inner light" is pursued without
                ceasing. In this certainty of "being aware", one brings
                to the table of life a sense of being part of the
                "whole". A unity with "all and everything".</p>
              <p>All these things are possible, they are not just "could
                be" or "might be" potentialities. They can and are
                possibilities. If one will make the conscious decision
                and effort to ask themselves; "What's it all about,
                Alfie? Why am I here in this time and space? What am I
                to be about? And who or what am I anyway?</p>
              <p>So be it....... </p>

              <p>"Grab your coat and get your hat." We are going to
                cross over to that other side of the street, where the
                sun is not shinning. And walk among the shadows and see
                those areas that bring so much misery, sorrow fear,
                worry, anxiety and loneliness.</p>
              <p>Look over there, crouched in the shadows of despair and
                lack of purpose. You will see Boredom and his two
                companions; Apathy and Indifference.</p>
              <p>There standing in the doorway, stands Jealousy,
                Distrust, Hatred and Envy.</p>
              <p>Did you notice that person, just now on that stationary
                bike. He is one of those who cannot learn from past
                errors and mistakes, going neither forward or backward.
                Just existing from day to day. Living not in the
                present, in the "now's " of life. neither seeing or
                understanding what is happening in the moment. Possibly
                self-centered{ obsessed with his own worries and
                troubles} to the exclusion of everything around him.
                Seemingly apprehensive to a fault, doom and gloom his
                daily diet, "the sky is falling" syndrome.</p>
              <p>There hiding in the alley way, huddled together are the
                self reproaching, who lack self-esteem, self- worth and
                self-respect. That can turn into resentment, anger,
                frustration and bitterness.</p>
              <p>We need to be getting back to the other side of the
                street, the sunny side. Before all this starts rubbing
                off on us. It can you know. If you spend to much time
                here. And then one starts singing the "blues in the
                night". And that other tune; "woe is me." </p>
