                  destruction. Are we not of the same seed from out of
                  the past. When we look at one another. Are we not
                  aware that our physical attributes and the materiality
                  of our bodies are much the same? Do not all who
                  procreate do so to extend and insure the survival of
                  the human species? Are not our basic needs of food,
                  shelter, clothing, love, acceptance, respect and of
                  course our right to the pursuit of happiness? Pretty

                  diversity does not call for separation, it calls for
                  unity, balance and peace. Our teacher is Nature. There
                  is nothing as diverse as Nature. And yet all the
                  countless expressions and imprints of this diversity
                  co-exist in harmony, balance and peace. We live in an
                  ordered Universe. Nature is a living example of unity.</font></p>

                  yours'. Multiply that by 40,000. Imagine a Football

                  an eye, they are all dead. All TV stations, all the

                  A failure instead of a success? No! To be "down"
                  instead of "up." No! It is hard to believe that we
