            <p>Before continuing&nbsp;with this self-remembering; I
              would ask the reader to allow me to gather myself and my
              thoughts for a moment. I said at the very beginning; that
              words cannot begin to catch all the nuances, the thoughts,
              the emotions, or the feelings of a person caught up in an
              existential moment. Whether that person, be ourselves or
              someone else.</p>
            <p>For the very minute we try to speak, as to what we are
              thinking or feeling, it become almost impossible to retain
              the purity of the said moment. And by purity, I do not
              mean this as a qualitative or a moralistic evaluation. But
              rather something with a perceived clarity, a realness in
              keeping with its' " is-ness, its'," thus-ness " To repeat
              what has been said earlier; we filter this " is-ness ",
              this moment of purity in and through our personal
              structuring of reality; as we see ourselves, the World and
              the things of the World. Thereby, diminishing the
              perceived moment. Making it beyond recognition.</p>
            <p>If only we could deal with the reality, as reality. And
              block out the resurgence of our doubts, our repressed and
              suppressed urges, fears and anxieties, our feelings of
              insecurity and inadequacies. We could better re-present
              what the moment of reality, just is.</p>
            <p>Should two people, be caught up in the same existential
              moment. And realize that they are capable of this
              mis-representation of reality as it is. Then maybe just
              maybe, we might begin to examine our own reality
              structuring of " All and Everything " And also inspect
              those building block realities on which we have built all
              our subsequent structuring.</p>
            <p>I am entering into the gray areas of remembering, looking
              into the past which is intermingled with possible biases,
              self-rationalizations and justifications. And no matter
              how hard one tries for objectivity, it is exceedingly
              difficult to keep the self from entering in. Because we
              are more often than not, highly subjective.</p>
            <p>I used the term, gray areas, for that is what they are,
              as we speak about past relationships and their staging
              pads. Also I have made the decision when talking about my
              relationships in marriage or marriages. That I will refer
              not by name to my ex-spouses. This is in no way meant to
              be, de-selfing or demeaning. It just seems to be more
              equitable.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><b>Back to the rest of the
                  story:</b>:</span></p>
            <p>When the first to be Mrs. arrived at the airport in Las
              Vegas from Atlanta, I was sure the Earth was tilting and
              that the stars had to be falling somewhere. We hurried
              back to the Ranch, and introductions were made all around.
              And then we got reacquainted, as they do say. The next day
              we were married. And like all newly-weds, we danced among
              the stars and pledged, '<i>forever and ever'.</i></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color:
                  #000000;">Al</span><b>ana,</b></span> was in a
              strange, different world and married. In a relationship
              with a man, she had dated less than a half dozen times.
              Also,&nbsp;to someone eight years her senior, whose life
              experiences exceeded his years. Of course Alana at
              eighteen, like most eighteen year- olds, felt quite
              mature, even though&nbsp;her life experience &nbsp;was
              confined to the family circle, within its' security and
              protection. And any other experiences were limited in
              scope.</p>
            <p>Alana, was starry-eyed and innocent in years, that was
              her charm. But the coping and adjusting to the life-style
              of Las Vegas,&nbsp;to the working hours of the Ranch,
              which was twenty-four hour a day, was not easy. Alana, was
              not what you would label as being a gregarious person. She
              was "stand-offish", kept to herself a lot; seemingly aloof
              at times. She sort of just tolerated people. I didn't know
              at first, why this was so but I learned later. There were
              those, as she so put it; " they are not my kind of
              people." I remember the owner, Bryon Foy, asked me one
              day; " Why does it seem that Alana tries to avoid me, have
              I done something to offend her? Is there anything I can
              do, to make her feel more at home?" I remarked "no " that
              it was something, she had to work out herself. I thought
              at the time, her mood swings would pass, but this was
              proven wrong, as days turned into months.. There were
              those times, I was not&nbsp;sure that Alana was aware of
              her personality shifts.</p>
            <p>The subject was never approached, but I often wondered;
              what was&nbsp;the conversation &nbsp;When she told her
              parents; that she was going to fly all the way to Las
              Vegas, to marry a man, she hardly knew and one they had
              not met.</p>
            <p>After about four months, Bryon was offered a price to
              sell the Guest Ranch, which he could not refuse. I knew
              the "Syndicate" would have their own personnel. And that
              my services would not be needed. Shortly, thereafter I
              took a job with the "Rommel Motel Chain", just on a
              temporary basis. A husband and wife team at one of the
              Motels had not had a vacation in two years. I took over
              while they went on a much deserved vacation. My new bride
              informed me that she was going back to Atlanta.
              To&nbsp;wait there until I finished at the Rommel. And as
              I had heard before, in those moments of her discontent; "
              my job, was not her cup of tea." The honeymoon period had
              drawn its' last breath. "The Dawn Of Reality" was the
              title of the new song replacing "Our Song".</p>
            <p>Alana was a gifted artist, with a creative talent that
              reached into Fashion designing. She could take a piece
              fabric, with no pattern, only the one she held in her
              mind. And create an original, stunning fashion. With a
              snip and a stitch, here and there. It was uncanny. She
              also could sketch or paint anything, with speed and ease.
              A raw primitive, untrained talent. I often wondered, to
              what heights could she have gone in the art world
              ?&nbsp;If she had traveled abroad and studied art. Or
              attended a creative&nbsp;School of Art here in the States.</p>
            <p>When I joined Alana in Atlanta, after leaving Vegas. I
              answered an advertisement, which read; " Needed a Country
              Club Manager with Resort or Hotel experience. Terms
              negotiable. Call such and such, Washington, Georgia. I
              contacted the number and set up an appointment. Drove down
              to the Club, met with the Chairman and several other of
              the members. Checked out the Club and its' facilities. We
              talked in general terms: about where the Club was
              financially, membership participation and the Clubs'
              possible future. We also talked about the percentage split
              of the food concession, the Golf Pro Shop and a possible
              bar operation, which at the time was non-existent. Also,
              how a cash flow might be generated to finance the needed
              repairs and renovations. A rough draft was made up to show
              to the rest of the board with some of the suggestions,
              which had been arrived at during the meeting.</p>
            <p>I drove back to Atlanta to await their call. Finally, the
              "powers to be" called. Alana and I drove down to
              Washington,Georgia. A Contract was drawn up and signed. We
              drove back to Atlanta to collect our belongings. All three
              of us, moved to Washington, Ga. Oh, yes!, we had a new
              addition to the family, a boxer pup named " Duke".</p>
            <p>It was decided, that if the Club was to succeed, we had
              to have a Lounge area. Where the members could come and
              have a few drinks after playing golf. Or come in the
              evenings and also on the weekends.</p>
            <p>The traditional Sunday buffets would continue. And we
              would add a Friday and a Saturday night buffet, as well.
              Along with some special weekends events. Picnic on the
              lawn, ice cream socials,&nbsp;cakewalks, dances, etc. We
              also, added various new Golf tournaments to the schedule.</p>
            <p>But the main attraction, the drawing card was the new
              Lounge area. Alana was in her element, we turned an old
              storage area into a night club. It was decided that the
              Lounge would have a tropical motif, "a la Trader Vic's".
              The walls were done in a grass matted effect, with bamboo
              strips running vertical down the walls to hid the seams of
              the matting. Large wine barrels were turned into Jungle
              Drums and simulated leather formed the top of the drums.
              Then round thick glass was cut for the table tops. Rattan
              chairs were placed around the drum tables. &nbsp;Rattan
              Bar stools for the bar. The bar itself was designed as a
              simulated grass hut, with decorative African tribal masks.</p>
            <p>But the centerpiece, the focal point which pulled
              everything together and made the Lounge. Was a
              breath-taking Black-light Mural that&nbsp;covered a good
              part of one of the walls. The people in Washington had
              never seen its' likes before. Not even in Atlanta.</p>
            <p>Alana, had created a jungle scene, of a beautiful young
              maiden, bathing beneath a cascading waterfall. With a
              tiger, coming through the jungle foliage The vivid colors
              were primitive, strong and bright. The Mural was a
              sensation, the talk of Washington, Ga.. Alana had out done
              herself. For a while she emerged out of her cocoon. She
              seemed less bored.</p>
            <p>The Club, was turning around; the tournaments, the
              socials, and the dinners were gaining a following. We were
              climbing out of the red.. People were enjoying the Club
              and its' facilities. It was becoming the place to meet.
              Less and less people were driving into Atlanta to
              celebrate. The Club was fulfilling a need.</p>
            <p>But the storm clouds were gathering, rumors and gossip
              about the Club and the Bar operation began to surface.</p>
            <p>(A side note)</p>
            <p>No alcoholic beverages were allowed to be sold within the
              Town limits, or the County. Even though we were out,
              beyond the towns' boundary lines. If you wanted to buy any
              kind of spirits. You had to cross over the County line and
              within a stones throw there was a large Package Store. By
              law, if you were caught bringing more than two bottles
              across the county line . You could be arrested for
              bootlegging and prosecuted.</p>
            <p>We got around the no bar, by establishing a locker
              system, with the members names on the bottles, so we were
              by all intent pouring out of their bottles. This procedure
              was used through-out Georgia, because many of the Counties
              in the State were dry. Where no alcohol was sold.</p>
            <p>As the storm clouds increased; the Club became the topic
              for the Minister of one of the local churches. His
              dialogue spoke about the existing " den of iniquity "
              outside our city limits, corrupting the youth of our town,
              while catering to drunks." But this was the same Minister
              riding his " hobby horse", who spoke about the sins of
              mixed bathing, in a swimming pool, while cavorting around
              half-nude. The amusing thing about his tirade, was that
              the only community type swimming pools were in Atlanta,
              Georgia, a couple of hours drive away.</p>
            <p>Some of the pillars of the Community, who were Deacons in
              this same said Church, were also Members of the Club, but
              inactive, They began to talk about having a referendum
              vote on the bar issue at the Country Club. The irony of it
              all, was that many of these same rabble rousers would go
              the Clubs in Atlanta, for a good-old-time. And then sneak
              back home in the wee hours.. Or they would have someone
              step across the county line, to buy their booze.
              Hypocrisy, had its' finest hour.</p>
            <p>The voting finally came to pass, after weeks of mud
              slinging. All the active members that used the Club,
              assured me that the opposition would not win. But I was
              wary of their prediction, small town politics can never be
              underestimated. There was a strong right guard, an old
              line "Confederate" mind set, that wielded a lot of
              influence. This was the same town, that rose up in arms
              about the State Highway Department of Georgia wanting to
              widen the main highway through town. But because of a
              large Oak tree that would have had to be removed. The town
              refused to remove the tree. This particular oak tree that
              the State wanted taken down, was where General Tombs of
              the Confederate Army was hung from, by the Union soldiers,
              just after the defeat of the South during the Civil War.
              Because of the City's refusal to allow the tree to be
              removed, the Highway Dept. built the new highway around
              the town. Consequently, the town&nbsp;died on the vine,
              because the diehards couldn't see beyond the end of their
              noses. Tunneled vision people have a tendency not to see
              the obvious.</p>
            <p>Sad to say; it seems the only way that this "head in the
              sand mentality" would ever change, &nbsp;a few premature
              deaths. A few premature deaths would have to happen.</p>
            <p><strong>Back to the story</strong></p>
            <p>When the day of the voting took place. I saw more&nbsp;
              strangers, than I had ever seen before, coming into the
              Club. I grabbed Mr. Shine, chairman of the Broad
              members&nbsp;and asked, who are all these people ?&nbsp;He
              just shook his head and said; most of them are the
              original Chartered Members. Some came in wheelchairs and
              with-walkers. The active members were out gunned. The
              opposition won hands down. All that was left, was the
              Clubs' funeral.</p>
            <p>Alana, Duke and I, stole silently out of town, back to
              Atlanta. We moved to Decatur, Ga., around the Stone
              Mountain area. I went to work at " Richs' " Department
              Store, doing Designer Display. But alas, Alana was not to
              happy in Atlanta. She yearned to go to those 'wide open
              spaces', where everything was bigger than big. Where they
              chased those long-horned critters and danced the two-step
              in their Stensons.and 'Tony Lama's' Alligator boots.</p>
            <p>Her Mother's brother and two sisters, lived in
              Houston,Texas. So Texas it was, back to the scene, the
              beginning where we met. I secured a job at " Foleys "
              doing display work. Having work at " Richs' " in Atlanta,
              gave me, immediate entree. " Richs' " Display Dept., had
              an unlimited budget , which allowed them full creative
              freedom.&nbsp; Richs' " Fashion windows and Interior
              displays were Internationally known in The Display World.</p>
            <p>To jump ahead, while working at Foleys, Alana and I
              decided to purchase a house in a sub-division, out past
              Airline Drive. The house was located on Ismael St. It
              was&nbsp;part wood, with a&nbsp;brick exterior. Two
              bedrooms, plus a very small room, off the
              hallway.&nbsp;near the front of the house; a living
              room,&nbsp;kitchen with an eating area and one bath. With
              a one car garage, a front lawn, along with a fenced in
              backyard. A typical sub-division home that cost
              approximately, $13,000 I used my GI loan at 4 1/2% to
              purchase the house. Alana wanted to purchase a home near
              Spring Branch where her uncle and aunts lived. The cost of
              real estate in the Spring Branch was out out of reach.</p>
            <p>Not too long afterwards, I ask Alana, if she would be
              interested in having an interview with Mr.Bob Dundas who
              was head of the Advertising Dept.at Foleys. I arranged a
              meeting for the two of them to meet.&nbsp;She worked up
              some fashion sketches, and the meeting was set. She had
              her interview with Mr. Dundas. To say, that he was
              interested in her portfolio would be a big Texas'
              understatement. He was taken back by Alana's unbelievable
              talent. I&nbsp;happened to be&nbsp;in Tom Curtis' office
              {Head of The Display Dept}, when&nbsp;Dundas brought her
              art work in to show him.&nbsp;Neither,&nbsp;could
              believed, that she had no formal art training. Or that
              she&nbsp;had never drawn newspaper fashion advertising
              before She joined the Advertising Department and became
              one of their top artist. As I had said before, she was
              unbelievably fast and good.</p>
            <p>And then, along came Missy "M&amp;M"; Madeline Michelle,
              the first baby at St. Josephs' Hospital to be borne using
              hypnosis. Alana didn't want a saddle block, nor any
              anesthesia to be used in her delivery. After calling all
              over Houston, and being turned down by the Medical
              profession. Hearing, such remarks from the physicians as
              "you can't be serious about wanting to perform your wives'
              delivery by hypnosis. Certainly, you are not qualified to
              undertake such a procedure. No doctor will allow you. The
              whole thing is absurd."</p>
            <p>Finally, a Dr. Ham, a female Gynecologist, agreed to
              allow me to perform the hypnosis, under the condition that
              I would allow a Psychiatrist, a friend of hers' to be
              present, as I put Alana under, during the induction
              period. And also to be present with me in the Delivery
              room in case of any complications, I agreed. The delivery
              went off without any problems. What a beautiful day! What
              a beautiful child!</p>
            <p>Later in, January of 1959, something happened that
              changed the course of events both for Alana, Madeline
              Michelle and for myself. I was diagnosed as having
              "Pulmonary Tuberculosis". The whole chain of events
              leading up to the final diagnosis of the dis-ease were
              both bizarre and puzzling. Up to that point I had no
              physical symptoms; the hacking cough, weigh loss, the low
              grade fever, along with the usual sputum. I felt like <i>'top
                of the heap</i>, <i>king of the hill'</i>. It was
              impossible, I could not have tuberculosis, the x-rays and
              the tests had to belong to someone else. A mistake had
              been made.</p>
            <p>I was admitted to St. Josephs' hospital immediately, upon
              the final findings. As a precautionary measure to protect
              the family. This was on a Monday, I was put in a private
              room, no visitors were allowed, I was by all intent and
              purpose contagious. The attending physician put me on
              several new drugs that were in their infancy. I took them
              after each meal, this went on for seven days. On the sixth
              day, I asked one of the nurses; "what was the going rate
              for a private room, plus all the additional costs?" She
              gave me a ball park figure, I immediately called my Doctor
              and asked him to please drop by the hospital. We needed to
              talk. Upon his arrival, I asked if he was still serving as
              a Consultant at the Veterans Hospital in Houston, he
              nodded "yes". My remark to him; "I am not going to die
              from tuberculosis but rather from bankruptcy. I am a
              Veteran, can you get me in the VA." He said he was sure he
              could.</p>
            <p>I was admitted to the VA Hospital on a Monday morning. A
              full week, after being admitted to St. Josephs' the prior
              Monday. And as is the Army's way of doing things I was
              given all the tests all over again. Even though my
              attending Doctor was a Consultant there at the VA.</p>
            <p>Here comes the puzzlement, all my tests came back
              negative, the only signs left were the three chest
              cavities that showed on my x-rays. And even they showed a
              difference in configuration... Would the Doctors believe
              the tests. <i>No!</i> Once again came the Gastrics and
              all the other tests they could think of. Still, at this
              point I had no underlying symptoms. Dr. Shoffner, head of
              the Tubercular Clinic was called in. They could not accept
              the fact that after six days on the new drug therapy I had
              moved from a positive culture to a negative status. After
              two more&nbsp;months, my cavities had calcified. They kept
              me in the hospital until August, it seemed like a lifetime
              to me. The entire time I was there, I felt like a caged
              lion, a healthy caged lion!</p>
            <p>I used to sneak out of the ward, which was a "<i>no no"</i>.
              Wearing a different patients' jacket and pants. I had
              bribed one of the Orderlies with a Cigarette rations card,
              I used to get. I didn't smoke, but I would trade off the
              cigarettes for candy or something else. The Tubercular
              ward patients wore a different colored uniform, which made
              them easy to spot. Once I had changed I would go to the
              hospital Movies. Sometimes go and play little ping pong or
              play a game of pool. Shoot some basketball in the gym and
              maybe pump a little iron.</p>
            <p>I was finally caught and put on report. And sent to the
              Psychiatrist, who wanted to know why I was flaunting the
              rules. My answer; "I am not sick. All the tests verify
              that I am cured, I am as healthy as you, if not more so.
              How would you feel, if you were sane and everyone, was
              trying to convince you other wise? How would you react to
              your confinement?" The charges were dropped.</p>
            <p>After the third month, I was able to have visitors. Alana
              came once, only once. Other wives came to visit, even
              before the third month and would stand outside the glass,
              and wave, even though they couldn't come in and the
              patients couldn't go out, some would even bring the
              children. But as they say; " different genes, different
              scenes." Alana had her "way". </p>
            <p>While in the hospital, I was awarded a World
              War&nbsp;II&nbsp;Disability pension. Which came to about
              $750 per. month, from the time I entered the hospital. The
              irony was, I had been discharged in 1947, twelve years
              prior. But the Review Board had awarded the pension on the
              grounds that I had contracted double pneumonia three times
              in the service. Once in basic training, at Camp Robinson
              in Little Rock, Arkansas and twice overseas. The
              predictions of my early birth trauma were coming true,
              Respiratory diseases would shadow me throughout my life..</p>
            <p>During this period, I had a lot time to examine, my life,
              my goals and my aspirations. Also, to look at my marriage.
              My relationship with Alana. Just how compatible were we as
              husband and wife? Did we need the same things in life? Why
              were we, so far apart, in how we looked at life? And what
              were the values we shared? It seemed as though, we were
              looking out a different window, as we were moving through
              life, but seeing different things</p>
            <p>Alana was infatuated, with the Spring Branch, lifestyle.
              It was her kind of life, her kind of people. Even I
              enjoyed, visiting the aunts and uncles, going to Juniors'
              summer place in Galveston .But it was not my life, nor my
              ambition. My spirit was elsewhere and it always had been.</p>
            <p>While in the hospital, I wrote a column for the weekly
              Hospital magazine. It was a column that spoke about
              lifestyles, purpose and meaning, values and priorities. A
              sort of a philosophical, religious, psychological
              "potpourri". Asking in one way or another, the question:
              what do each of us, have to bring to the table of life, or
              to the World, or to our separate relationships. I found
              myself in a continuing conversation with the other
              patients and the Staff, speaking about life and its'
              meaning.</p>
            <p>After a lot of soul searching in the hospital. Asking
              myself, what have I given of myself, beyond making a
              living. The answer; "very little, came loud and strong".
              Up to that point in my life, I had done so many things,
              seen so many things, felt so many things. My questions
              were many, my answers so few. But I knew one thing. I had
              to keep searching and seeking for the answers; " Who am
              I?, Why am I here? and Where am I going? " This was not a
              self-identity search, this was a soul search; a search for
              my beginnings. My essence, my is-ness, my intrinsic core,
              that " Image " I was created to be. The semantics, the
              rhetoric's was not important. What was important was the
              "awareness, the "knowing". The process of expansion; the
              seeking, the searching, the asking, the probing, the
              experiencing of the " All and Everything " was essential
              for me.</p>
            <p>Herein, Alana and I were not on the same wave-length. Our
              needs were different and our life meaning and purpose was
              different. It was not a question of who was right or
              wrong. It became an " Awareness ", that our existing
              relationship was not the best for Alana, Michelle or for
              me. The petty arguments, the bickering, the gloom, the
              mood swings, the dissatisfaction and discontentment, these
              were not conducive for any of us. No child should be
              raised in an atmosphere, where there is a constant
              negativity. Where love had been replaced; with resentment,
              anger and pride. And I should know this&nbsp;better than
              anyone. It was a repeat of my childhood.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The decision I reached was to somehow enter the Ministry
              of the Church. I knew it would take place, it would
              happen. How? When? What denomination? I did not know? The
              logistics, the timing, I did not know, but it would come
              to pass. My decision was not based on a " road to Damascus
              " experience. It was based on my need to give of myself.
              And also my need to search and to seek after.</p>
            <div>I was released from the hospital just before my
              32nd.birthday in August I returned to work. And played in
              a Fast Pitch Softball Tournament. It was good to be back
              playing again, after being cooped up for so long. While in
              the hospital; Michelle had learned to talk and walk, and
              do those little prissy things, that little girls do. At
              first, she was not to sure about this giant with the deep
              voice. But little by little, we were reunited. And, "da,
              da" fell from her lips, as she would climb up into my lap
              and fall asleep.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>{A sober reflection</div>
            <div>A pause if you will permit.}</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>The one memory of my confinement from my eight months
              in the Hospital, that was difficult to come to terms with.
              Was Alana's indifference and lack of concern; during my
              hospital stay; one telephone call and one visit. Upon my
              release there was no coming home party; no, "Its' great to
              have you home again, I missed you" Surely that would have
              been appropriate and appreciated. But alas! While the cat
              is away the mice will play. So, they do say.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>Well, back to the rest of the Story!</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>During the month of August, there was a lifeless
              feeling, a shut down, a lull, a distance in the air, when
              Alana and I were in the same room, even when we made love.
              ( It was like there was someone else in the room) We were
              civil to one another, but our conversations were guarded
              and hesitant. For those around us, we played our
              respective roles. From time to time, I would try subtly,
              to hint about my decision to enter the Ministry. But from
              the various remarks and more in what Alana did not say,
              when I spoke about changing professions and my leanings
              towards the Ministry. It was evident that she did not want
              to be a ministers' wife.</div>
            <p>That same month, we planned a camping and a fishing trip
              with our next door neighbors, Gene and Lorraine. We
              borrowed, Junior's trailer and headed off to Lake Austin.
              Gene and I, used to do a little fishing together. Shoot
              the breeze over the fence. Lorraine and Alana were
              sometime friends, more like acquaintances. {A note: in
              almost all the sevens years of our marriage, I can't
              remember Alana making any real close lady friends. besides
              her aunts}. We finally arrived at Lake Austin and set up
              camp. Ready to relax and enjoy ourselves. But Alana, was
              not a very "happy camper". I thought at first that
              probably, it was the long trip, also Michelle was acting
              up, or maybe it was just my imagination.</p>
            <p>Morning came, Gene and I were up bright and early to
              string some trot lines. So we could have fish for dinner,
              that night. The girls were still asleep. After, we strung
              the lines and baited them. Gene and I, did some plugging
              and some plastic worm fishing. And then some trolling back
              to the campsite. Gene and I had commented on the way back,
              that it would sure be nice if breakfast had been started.
              After docking the boat, we walked towards the campsite.
              But we couldn't see the girls, in fact there was no
              visible signs of life. We hastened our steps, when we got
              there. I opened the trailer door, Alana was sitting on the
              bed. Before I could speak, she said in a loud enough
              voice; That could have been heard in the halls of the
              Capital. " I want to go home." This was a stupid idea in
              the first place. I don't like it here. I don't want to be
              here. I asked her to lower her voice. " I don't care, if
              they do hear me their your friends not mine, they are not
              my kind of people." Those familiar words rang out once
              more.</p>
            <p>I had heard this line of snobbery before at the Guest
              Ranch also&nbsp;in relation to the wives and husbands of
              the Softball team, I had played on. And about the people I
              worked with, and there wives. Which brings to mind a most
              regrettable moment, near the beginning of the end.</p>
            <p>One day, Alana was on one of her "fit flights" about
              money and she had run out things to say about my job at
              Foleys and where we lived. She said in her most caustic
              acid tone: " I know why you work there, with all those
              "queers", those homosexuals referring to the Display Dept.
              I believe you are one yourself." And you won't admit it."
              The straw broke, I wheeled and backhanded her and walked
              out of the house. Up to that time, I had never every laid
              a hand on a woman in my life. I couldn't believe that I
              had pulled such an immature stunt. I knew better, than to
              let her get to me. I was taught never to strike a woman.
              Under any circumstances.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;">Back to the story:</span></p>
            <p>I want you go out, an apologize to Gene and Lorraine. " I
              will not " Okay, then just ." Shut up ". I'll go out an
              apologize. I went out and said; I am sorry , you heard all
              that, I think it's best that we leave. Again I am sorry..
              We packed up, and left. We returned home in silence That
              incident took all the icing off the cake.</p>
            <p>I told Alana, I was out of the marriage. File the divorce
              papers, I would not contest it and she was free to state
              any reason she wanted to give, as to the grounds for the
              divorce. Mental cruelty, incompatibility, I left the
              toilet seat up, or the cap off the toothpaste. Everything
              was hers, except my clothes, golf clubs, books, and car.</p>
            <p>Seven years of bickering. My regret was Michelle, but I
              knew that Alana could provide for her, and that she would
              care for her. The present atmosphere was not conducive for
              bringing up a child. Nor was it conducive for Alana and I.
              The things she felt, she needed to give meaning to her
              life were not what I needed, nor would I ever need. Our
              posturing was different, our needs, wants, values and
              goals didn't come close. Financially, I knew Alana would
              be earning far more than I would be earning in the
              Ministry. And that she would be married or be living with
              someone, quickly. My predictions were true.</p>
            <p>While waiting for the divorce to become final, I took a
              job as a Real Estate salesman, selling track homes in a
              sub-division. The Realtor I worked for was Don Milheim,
              whose office at the time was located on Airline Drive.
              While working for Don, I was making plans to enter the
              ministry. I visited all kinds of Churches, from the High
              Churches to the Bible thumping, "slain in the spirit"
              congregations. My only experience with a Church had been
              in my early formative years, a small rural Baptist Church
              and the Catholic Church. My High School training was at La
              Salle Military Academy, in Troy , New York, which was run
              by the Brothers. But because of doctrinal differences, I
              broke from the Catholic Church when I was fifteen.</p>
            <p>One Sunday morning, I was walking in the downtown area of
              Houston, looking for a place to eat breakfast. I passed by
              the First Methodist Church, Dr. Charles Allen was the
              Pastor. I stopped briefly and look at the outside Marquee.
              Just as I started to turn away, a young man in his early
              twenties invited me to visit his Sunday school class. A
              singles' class of young professionals, he said;"that this
              morning Dr. Richard Murray will be teaching about " What
              Methodists Believe , Would I be interested?" I said; "
              Yes.</p>
            <p>I was introduce to the Class. Afterwards, some
              announcements were made, a couple of songs and then a
              collection was taken. Mr. Murrary, begin his introductory
              remarks about the "Methodist Beliefs" and commented on
              John Wesley, the creative spirit behind early Methodism.</p>
            <p>Up until that time; my only acquaintance
              with&nbsp;Methodism, was as a child. My uncles and aunts
              belonged to the Methodist Church in Greencastle, Indiana.
              At Christmas&nbsp;and Easter, we would drive in from the
              farm and attend the Holiday services with them.</p>
            <p>Out of the lecture, a single thought struck a responsive
              chord, or to use Wesley's words; "my heart was strangely
              warmed". Wesley believed that the intellect and the spirit
              should be united. The mind was a gracious gift, not to be
              degraded when it came to spiritual matters. That we were
              to use our minds in our spiritual quest and in our
              spiritual development. And Wesley's remark, after being
              forced out of the church, while he was preaching in the
              fields. Was asked; where is your parish? He said; "the
              World is my parish". These two remarks caused my swing to
              Methodism. The World became my parish.</p>
            <p>And in a way; "the World" is still my parish. Only my
              thoughts, words and&nbsp; rhetoric have a different spin.</p>
            <p>As the lecture was being presented, my eyes exchanged
              glances with a very attractive young lady. After the
              lecture was over, the same young man that had invited me,
              came up and asked;" Did you enjoy the lecture?" I replied
              in the affirmative. He said by the way, we usually go to
              "Pizza Hut" in the evening , would you be interested in
              coming. I thought; "I wonder if she will be there"? "Why
              not", I replied. That evening, she was there. again we
              exchanged guarded glances and would turn away. The evening
              ended, but I had found out her name.</p>
            <p>The following Sunday, I was back in the class, Richard
              Murray was to continue where he had left off, about what
              Methodists believe? And <b><span style="color: #cc0000;">Babs</span></b>
              was there. After class I asked her out that Sunday
              evening. We went to the Movies, and if you were to ask
              what Movie was playing? I surely don't know. Sometime
              during the evening, I told Babs about the impending
              divorce proceedings and when it would become final</p>
            <p>We had a whirlwind romance, at first her parents objected
              to our seeing each other, so often. The divorce and the
              age difference were the topics of discussion. Babs was 19,
              going on twenty-five, I was 33. But the family slowly came
              around. The divorce was finalized, no contest, no hitches.
              Babs and I were married, in the First United Methodist
              Church in Houston.&nbsp;We moved into an apartment just
              blocks away from&nbsp;her parents in the Heights.</p>
            <p>During the waiting period and our courtship, I had been
              talking to Richard Murray about the ministry. About the
              requirements needed, just how does one go about entering
              the ministry? He replied; the usual way is graduation from
              High School, then four years of undergraduate work and a
              diploma. Then applying for admission into a Seminary.
              Well, all the above, was out of reach for me at the time.
              For, I had neither a diploma from High School or College.</p>
            <div>Then Richard&nbsp;went on to say;" what I needed to do,
              was first get my " License to Preach " Then apply to the
              Conference to be admitted to do the "Conference Course Of
              Study." And then asked to be appointed as a Supply Pastor,
              come the June Conference. I told Babs and her parents
              about my plans. Babs still was not fully conscious of
              where I was heading. " Love conquers all" thought I,
              foolish me!.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>Babs was out of the house, the "apron strings had been
              cut", she was playing house, decorating and picking up
              things for the apartment. I believe one of the most
              popular reasons for young girls getting married, is to
              break those "strings", to leave the nest. To be out of the
              house..."freedom". Of course like all newlyweds, we were
              ecstatically attracted to each other. If we could have
              lived on love, we would have lived only in the bedroom.
              But, alas, there is reality. It comes waltzing through the
              door. And what is reality to a nineteen year old?</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>She was going to marry a man who was going into the
              Ministry, which meant she was about to become a Minister's
              wife. But the full impact was yet to sink in. This
              scenario, was not what she pictured at all, with a capital
              A, a&nbsp;minister's wife!!!</div>
            <p>The night finally arrived, the night when the Conference
              Appointments were to be read in the Sanctuary of the First
              Methodist Church in Houston, Four hundred plus Ministers
              and some of their families were gathered to hear Bishop
              Martin read the appointments. Near the end, I finally
              heard; H.Lee Mc Ginnis, appointed to Bullard, Texas as a
              Supply Pastor. I turned and asked the Pastor next to me;
              where is Bullard,Texas? He shrugged his shoulders.
              &nbsp;After the reading of the Appointments was over, I
              found Babs and her parents and they asked the same
              question that I had asked; " Where is Bullard?" I then,
              shrugged my shoulders. Let's find a Journal, it will tell
              us the District and the location.</p>
            <p>Well, it was located in East Texas, the Bible Belt of
              Texas, deep in Cattle country and the wide open spaces. A
              little town with a population of 213 people. Whose
              Downtown consisted of two grocery stores. A Post Office in
              one of the stores Two filling Stations, a Dry Goods Store
              and a Hardware Store. And three churches; a Methodist, a
              Baptist and a Church Of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Methodist Church, up until my appointment, had been a
              students' charge, a Circuit Church with two other
              Churches. The Church was located in the Tyler District .Dr
              Durwood Blackwell was the presiding District
              Superintendent.</p>
            <p>When Babs heard all the particulars, this City lady,
              wanted no part of it. The Civil War was on, and paradise
              was in jeopardy. Margie, Bill and I try to soothe the
              troubled waters, that was slowly becoming a Tidal Wave
              that threatened both Babs and I.</p>
            <p>Statements that I was to hear more times than I wanted to
              hear, later on: " You chose the Ministry, I did not. I
              don't want to be a Ministers' wife. I won't go to Church..
              I will stay home. You can't make me go to Church. I don't
              want to live in Bullard, Texas, where there is only two
              hundred people. what am I suppose to do? " The questions
              poured out like a torrent. Little did I know, or maybe I
              didn't want to know. That the seeds, were beginning to
              germinate, and would come to full bloom in the Winter of
              our marriage.</p>
