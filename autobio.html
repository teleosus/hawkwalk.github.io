        <strong>Preface</strong><br>
        <br>
        Many have asked for a more detailed profile of my life than what
        is found on the website. These requests have increased over the
        last six or seven years. So I have decided to honor the requests<br>
        <br>
        Introduction <br>
        <br>
        To reconstruct all the nuances and variants of one's past
        history is indeed a daunting task. Especially since I have lived
        and I underline the word lived with the broadest of strokes. It
        is one thing to just exist and quite another to live "Life" to
        it's fullest. Experiencing the "All and Everything" which has
        been given in such an abundance, so it might be experienced.<br>
        <br>
        My glass has never been empty; the more I drink the more I have.
        Along the same line as; the more I learn, the more there is to
        be learned. The more I give the more I receive. Well, you get
        the point.<br>
        <br>
        My journey through life has led me into the wildernesses;
        through the veil of tears and sorrows. Out of the lowlands to
        walk in the mountains, high above the clouds of hopelessness and
        meaninglessness. So I might inhale and feel the sheer excitement
        and wonderment of being allowed to live in the midst of this
        ongoing unfathomable Cosmos that nullifies all description of
        the how and why? What a privilege to be a part of, whatever the
        purpose may be.<br>
        <br>
        The spring and summer winds of yesteryear have come and
        gone.&nbsp;While the days left&nbsp;of my autumn are but a
        precious few.&nbsp;As the winter of my life is waiting to
        embrace me. As&nbsp;to the length of its' days and nights I do
        not know? But my Eighty years has taught me that each new day is
        a gift for which a daily thanksgiving should be offered. The
        expression of words that follow will be an attempt to define my
        life which is but a nano-flicker of "The Flame of Creation." And
        because this is so, any sequence of mere words, regardless of
        their arrangement would be inadequate in capturing the height,
        width and depth of even a blade of grass let alone a definitive
        description as to "who and what I am or why I am?"<br>
        <br>
        The words: a "daunting task" is indeed just&nbsp;that. For this
        exercise to remember; asks of me to walk back into the past and
        unearth many of the memories which I have either buried or
        detached myself from. The difficulty lies in my preference to
        treat the past as there is no past, the future as there is no
        future. This is why I so often refer to the words:" Let the dead
        bury the dead". And adding a relative word, 'Life is for the
        living', the living of the 'Now'. The past and the future are
        within the 'Now'. We might even say; that each of us holds in
        our hands&nbsp;the "Eternal and the "Infinite." Would you agree?
        Yes!<br>
        <br>
        Those who 'see and hear' are aware that whatever has a beginning
        has an ending. Because of this awareness; their earthly life is
        a momentary reflection, a relative reference point to "That"
        which "<em>Just is</em>". And those that have eyes to see and
        ears to hear; have always been and always will be. One and the
        Same with "All and Everything" and with "That which Just Is" Is
        there a word for this "already, already unconditional
        condition", not really. But if you need one, let's call it; the
        "<em>One for All and All for One, unconditional condition</em>."<br>
        <br>
        My, my, how I do carry on!<br>
        <br>
        I ask of the reader to appreciate my dilemma which is somewhere
        between the "rock and the hard place". Because under lying this
        quandary is the ever haunting question; "What is Truth?" And
        Truth is part and parcel of this remembering exercise.<br>
        <br>
        Would you agree that our seeing and hearing is filtered, is
        partial at best? Do we not create the separate worlds we live
        in? And write the scripts of our belief systems, lifestyles,
        preferences, attitudes, wants and desires? And yes, do we not
        have a hand in creating our woes, worries and fears? We are
        probably one of the most diversified and complex species roaming
        this planet.<br>
        <br>
        The thoughts and words which I have written up to now have been
        as much for my eyes as for the eyes of the reader to remind me
        to be as factual and as transparent as possible. And to use the
        necessary discretion as needed, when it comes to the other
        players that will surface from time to time on this stage. I
        will not try to justify any of the actions of those who will
        appear between these pages. Nor will I justify my own. <br>
        <br>
        Please allow a personal note, if you will. I was asked about an
        experience I had mentioned during a "Hawk Talk" at a University;
        "Were you telling us the truth. Did that really happen to you?
        My reply "Yes, give or take a fact here or there".<br>
        <br>
        Come let's take a serendipity stroll; in,through and beyond
        time. We will walk some of the paths and by-ways of past
        memories and reflections. Hesitating now and then to listen for
        some of the fainter echoes; the long forgotten and those which
        were buried very deep.<br>
        <br>
        Let's start with the words: "It's a boy, he's a survivor and so
        is his Mother". These words announced a new arrival on this
        spinning planet called Earth; a seven month preemie that could
        be held in one hand, weighing in at three pounds. My auspicious
        appearance was commemorated by two endearing comments. One by my
        Grandfather (whom later I called " Ga Ga ") who said upon seeing
        me for the first time, "he looks like a fresh red skinned
        squirrel". And he spoke out of experience; he had shot and
        cleaned his share. Luckily after his words, I didn't acquire the
        nickname, "Here comes Squirrelly." The second accolade came from
        one of the nurses who helped in the delivery. "He's (referring
        to me) no bigger than a cricket" No one asked at the time but
        surely she was from Texas , where everything is 'bigger than
        big'. Hoosier crickets don't get that big. Least ways, I have
        never seen one.<br>
        <br>
        Caesarean births in the early 20th.Century were not that common
        in the rural areas. The odds for living were on the downside.
        But odds or no odds, the "Will of Life" had been imprinted on a
        very tiny new born that magic day of days.The "Breath of Life"
        was not to be denied.<br>
        <br>
        Much later I learned that my Father and Grandparents to be were
        told by the attending Physician that my lungs and respiratory
        system had not reached their full development. And that this
        might cause respiratory problems later in my life. He went on to
        say, that due to the lack of development, my lungs could
        collapse which would be fatal.<br>
        <br>
        At this point my Grandmother said; "if there is a chance that he
        could die, it will not be in the Hospital, but at home." Words
        were exchanged between the Doctor and Grandmother both arguing
        from their respective corners. And the winner was, the little
        white-haired Grandmother from Putnam County . I was covered with
        a sea of cotton and then wrapped up "like a piggy in a blanket".
        And away we went via an ambulance from Indianapolis to to the
        farm.&nbsp;My mother had complications and was put in the
        Intensive Care Ward.<br>
        <br>
        Upon arrival it was decided that part of the kitchen would be
        turned into a nursery. The kitchen was the largest square
        footage in the farmhouse and the warmest. My Grandfather and my
        two Uncles quickly went about constructing my own tanning salon.
        A little incubator similar to the ones used for hatching little
        baby chicks. The heat was supplied by a series of reflectors and
        incandescent lamps. (A bit of Yankee know how"). Upon
        completion, I was slicked down with olive oil like a leaf of
        Romaine lettuce, then swaddled in cotton and placed inside my
        new home for the next several months.<br>
        <br>
        Routine feedings were prepared from an old milk formula that had
        been handed down from a lineage of Mothers and Grandmothers. Its
        ingredients were as 'hush', 'hush' as 'Colonel Sanders' Kentucky
        Fried Chicken' recipe. I was fed with an eye dropper (you see I
        had a "wee" mouth, a little bit bigger than a cricket's mouth).
        The fresh formula of cows' milk with its' added ingredients was
        a direct feed from the "udder" to my waiting mouth. No
        pasteurizing or homogenizing. And it was delivered with "tender
        loving care" To borrow a phrase from the story of "Goldilocks
        and The Three Bears". "It was just right" (there was no udder)
        Just having a little fun folks! Spoiled? Pampered? I was
        probably one of the most pampered, watched over and asked about
        baby in the farm community. My Grandmother and two Aunts
        monitored me for the first two months of my young life on a
        twenty-four hour schedule. After my Mother recovered, she joined
        the trio of my Florence Nightingale staff. I had a lot of
        sideline cheerleaders.<br>
        <br>
        Allow me a detour, but only momentarily. During my early
        formative years and even before conception, I was read to; first
        by my Mother while I was comfortably resting in my private
        sleeping bag prior to my being lifted out and put on display for
        all to see. Afterwards my Grandmother and Aunts continued to
        read to me up through the first year. My Mother after she was
        released from the hospital joined the Reading Club. What was
        read; I'm not exactly sure but an educated guess would be that
        my Mother and Aunts read the current Children's stories
        (Aesop's' Fables, Hans Christian Anderson's Collection of
        Nursery Rhymes and&nbsp;Grime's Fairy Tales) while my
        Grandmother tutored me, with a Biblical Baptist running
        commentary about the co-habituating of Adam and Eve, Noah and
        his Floating Circus of two by two and the parting of the Red Sea
        without the help of Cecil B. and Mr. Charles&nbsp;Heston.<br>
        <br>
        My Mother and Grandmother seldom agreed on anything. If the moon
        was discussed as to its' color, one would say red and the other
        would say green. But oddly enough they did agree and believed
        that reading to a child before his/her birth and after, was
        beneficial in the nurturing and education of the child. Both
        were ahead of their time. For the experts of today agree to the
        validity of this practice. (But as they do say; "there is
        nothing new under the sun"). The Spartan mothers used to talk to
        their baby sons while they slept, about the great Spartan
        Warriors and their heroics. This reading to me continued on to
        three years of age. After that I did the reading with a little
        help from the giants, when it came to those big words. I would
        read to anyone wither they listened or not. The cats, dog, moo,
        moos, the 'quacks, quacks', the 'clucks, clucks' and even the
        horses, they all got an earful. If there was no one to read too,
        I would read out loud to myself.<br>
        <br>
        Because of my reading and asking about the big words, "why"
        became my favorite word. My Uncle Harrison gave me a new
        nickname the "Why Boy". I was a regular walking 'Question Box'.
        If I got to persistent asking my Grandmother "why", she would
        say: young man, curiosity is what killed the cat". I never knew
        'what in Sam hill' that meant for a long time. I knew what
        curiosity meant. But why it killed the cat was beyond me. All
        the farm cats' nine lives were intact.<br>
        <br>
        The foresight of my elders caused me to be an accomplished
        reader. By five years of age, I was reading my Grandfather's
        National Geographic, my favorite all time magazine. My
        Grandfather never tired of me asking how to pronounce a certain
        word and its' meaning. One of my show business tricks that got a
        chuckle was to pick-up the newspaper and act like I was giving
        the news on Radio. If I didn't know a certain word I would just
        make one up and go right on 'lickity split.' What came out got
        the laugh. When friends of the family would visit, my
        Grandfather would say; "do the News Harry Lee" I would get a
        spoon and use it for a microphone and go into my "Lowell Thomas"
        act. I should have charged admission.<br>
        <br>
        Even before I could read the N.G., I loved looking at the
        beautiful pictures of all those far away places with their
        strange sounding names. But there were certain rules that were
        to be followed if I wanted to look at or read this Special
        Magazine. I was to make sure my hands were clean. It was to be
        read in the parlour in a chair not on the floor. And I was to be
        very careful in turning the pages, so as not to damage them.<br>
        <br>
        One day while reading the N.G., I decided I wanted a peanut
        butter and jam sandwich. So I took the magazine with me into the
        kitchen and laid it down on the kitchen table and proceeded to
        fix myself a sandwich. While I was eating and reading, a big
        glob of blueberry jam fell smack dab in the middle of the page
        covering the face of somebody who suddenly became a nobody. I
        tried to clean it but it only made it worse. What to do? Well, I
        buried that copy among some back issues. And I didn't say a word
        about it.<br>
        <br>
        Three or four days passed, my Grandfather said nothing. Saturday
        came around, the day we were going into Greencastle. A day I
        always looked forward too. We piled into the Ford Truck and
        drove to Greencastle, I was elated. Grandfather and Grandmother
        had their things to do. And I had my thing to do which was going
        to the Movies. When we arrived, we all got out. Grandfather told
        Grandmother to go on ahead, he would catch up. He turned to me
        and said;"and what are you going to do?" I said: "go to the
        Movie." Do you have any money?" "No", I replied. He looked me
        straight in the eye and said; "when were you going to tell me
        about the National Geographic"? I hemmed and hawed, breaking eye
        contact which was a "no" "no" when speaking to him. He
        continued; "only a coward when he does something wrong will lie
        about it or try to hide it. Do I have a grandson that's a
        coward?" "No Sir" I started to cry and he said; crying will not
        do any good. What do you have to say"? I finally got the words
        out of my mouth. "I am sorry: I will not do that again, I
        promise." He smiled, here's two dimes go to the movies.<br>
        <br>
        I haven't thought of that incident for a long, long time but it
        is, as if it were yesterday. Ga Ga ' was a man that told it like
        it was, he could be as tough as nails and as&nbsp;unyielding but
        he was always fair.<br>
        <br>
        There I go again, getting ahead of myself. Let's backup;<br>
        <br>
        Long before, but not to long before I was so abruptly removed
        from my warm watery sleeping cocoon which was attached to
        someone I would later call "Mother. A full June, Moon, Love
        affair burst upon the scene that involved my soon to be parents,
        a 'mummy and daddy and baby makes three "twiddle dum, twiddle
        dee". The boy was twenty and the girl eighteen going on twenty
        three if, you know what I mean ("ooh! la, la.") Neither her
        parents nor his parents were dancing a jig or singing; "Get to
        me the Church on time" over this whirlwind romance. Well the
        stars fell out of the sky and a lot of those little hormones'
        started to do the "bunny-hop", up, down and all around reaching
        'Mach' speed. The Sound Barrier was broken. And guess what? You
        guessed it, Martha was with child. And Lloyd, well he became an
        instant Father, faster than instant soup becomes instant. And
        little old me was on my way to "Old Broadway", no the wrong
        words. It's my computer just trying to have a little fun, folks!
        Where was I? I was on my way to becoming a 'Special Delivery'
        surprise package,increasing the population count&nbsp;of Putnam
        County .<br>
        <br>
        Lloyd was the youngest of the three sons of the McGinnis Clan.
        Martha was the younger of the two daughters of the Glidewell
        family, the apple of her Father's eye. Faster than you can say:
        "Peter Piper picked a ..." The love birds were quickly married
        because the Bun (that's me) in the oven was about ready to be
        taken out and I do mean out! I was already, knocking at the door
        so to speak. If there had been a zipper I could have been at the
        Wedding Reception.<br>
        <br>
        Both parents somehow weathered the storm of the "Whispering
        Campaign" and the five and six party lines of the
        'Ring-a-ding-ding Marathon ' that was melting the telephone
        lines between Fillmore and Greencastle were ringing off the
        wall. (Have you heard.... did you know?). Into this Cauldron of
        wagging tongues; a little 'Spice' was added to this "brew ha,
        ha!" by my Grandmother. She was convinced that this red-headed
        vixen, that was one of her nicer words for my Mother, had laid a
        "tender trap" and snared her favorite son by getting pregnant.
        To thicken the pot, it was rumored, so she said; that this siren
        had had other torrid love affairs and possibly an abortion. This
        all pre-dated the age of "Soap Operas" even before "Stella
        Dallas" and "One Man's Family made their debut on Radio. The
        whopper&nbsp;topper to all this; my Mother and Father ended up
        moving in to live with his parents. Which was not the most
        conducive of circumstances under the circumstances, if you know
        what I mean? In fact it was an act of sheer insanity.<br>
        <br>
        After the delivery my Mother remained in the hospital because of
        complications. One being, she had an ovarian infection that
        precipitated the need for the Caesarean delivery. During her
        stay they decided that she needed a hysterectomy sans I became
        an only child. Her recovery was slow and tedious. Between her
        recovery and my situation it was a trying time for all
        concerned. Except for me, I was pampered all over the place.
        Before continuing on, let's take a breather and go to something
        a little bit lighter. Like 'Mac Arthur', I promise " I shall
        return" to the shores of despair, mal-contentment and
        resentment. All the trials and tribulations of a summer re-run
        of "How Are You Going to Keep Them down On the
        Farm".........After the divorce.<br>
        <br>
        I had mentioned earlier about being an early talker and walker.
        It was said; that my early steps were not really steps. I ran
        everywhere, when I was not running I was skipping, jumping and
        hopping. Strange words began to surface about my manner of
        movement; words such as; a jumping jack, a Mexican jumping bean,
        a wiggle-worm and a jack-in-the-box. One day, someone asked
        Grandfather: "where does your grandson get all that energy? He
        never sits still for one minute". "Well" said my Grandfather,
        "every morning I scoop up a hand full of ants and slip them in
        to his pants' pocket".<br>
        <br>
        There were those days as a toddler when I just couldn't resist
        being the "Masked Menace" of the barnyard. My very favourite
        'Chase' was with my arms out stretched like an airplane. I would
        zero in on an unsuspecting chicken pretending I was&nbsp;a pilot
        on a 'search and destroy' mission. After I had circled the field
        several times and scared the feathers of off four or five of the
        fleeing enemy. It was time to come in for a landing and have a
        couple of shots at the Bar. The table, I mean, of my
        Grandmother's 'Extra Special' Lemonade and a large side order of
        freshly baked Chocolate Chip cookies, the Houses' Specialty.<br>
        <br>
        But one day, just as the fog was lifting the "Masked Menace"
        took to the sky, unaware of his fate that day. The famous "Herr
        von Cock-a-doodle doo", the 'Scourge' of the airways, known by
        his friends and admirers as the "The Big Red Baron" had circled
        the field twice unnoticed and was hiding behind the drifting
        fog. The stage was set; the "Chase" was on. But that day M.M.
        became the chas-ee. The "Red Baron" had dropped out from behind
        the fog and was hot on the tail of the "Masked Menace" and
        closing fast, closer and closer. M.M. was out gunned and out
        ran, losing ground fast. The "Red Baron" was lined up for the
        kill. It was "certain curtains" for M.M. But suddenly like a
        lighting bolt out of the blue came the "Flying Grandma" with her
        Blazing Broom sweeping the air as she swooped down on "Big Red".
        He was no match for the swinging Veteran. Big Red lost the
        battle and limped away, battered and bowed. He had tried his
        best moves but his best was not good enough that day.<br>
        <br>
        Several days after my harrowing escape, I believe it was on a
        Sunday, yes, Sunday. The Preacher, that's what they do say
        "Preacher", came to dinner. Big Red appeared again but it was
        "Taps" for him. He was served up on a big white platter. He was
        resting on a mound of fresh roasted yellow corn, his favourite
        food. As the prayer was offered by the Preacher, I thought to
        myself, he was a tough old bird. "No" not the Preacher, Big Red.
        It was "bye, bye birdie" time. The young chicks would surely
        miss him. But when the new 'Cock of the Walk' arrived, he
        strutted across the barnyard so the young and the old could see
        what a fine fellow he was. The widows of the roost mourned no
        more. He was a real flapper-dapper, so much so; that it wasn't
        to long before the lady chicks were looking for a bushel basket
        to hide under.<br>
        <br>
        The rest of the farm animals (the pigs, cows, horses, ducks and
        cats) became my friends. I talked to them and always wondered if
        they understood anything I ever said. But there was one animal,
        I was sure he understood. His name was Shep, we were the best of
        friends, all though it took a little time. Shep's pedigree was
        questionable; he was part Collie, a little more German shepherd,
        a bit of this and a more of that. Shep had been on the scene a
        few years prior to my arrival. He was Grandfather's dog.
        Wherever " Ga , Ga " went ( I never got the word Grandfather
        untwisted from around my tongue) Shep was sure to follow. At
        first Shep ignored me, he tolerated me when I would tug on him
        or try to ride him. Otherwise he stayed his distance<br>
        <br>
        One day, I was around five; I wandered into the woods to pick
        some blue berries that my Grandmother and I had found. I had
        just started to pick some and from out of "no where"; an ugly
        big black, burly dog suddenly appeared. He was unfamiliar to me,
        most of the neighboring dogs I knew. But this one didn't look
        like, if you said; "roll over and play dead" that your wish
        would be his command. Rather his look was more like, "I've
        gotcha, your mine, yum, yum". I turned and took two steps and a
        leap. I was perched in the bough of a tree and five feet below
        me was a snarling, snapping dog, which I was dead sure, was
        going to eat me alive. I started yelling, yelling and some more
        yelling. And quicker than you can say; "Holy Molley" there was
        Shep in mid-air. The fight was on and I had a ringside ticket.
        Two masses of "fur and fury" whirled beneath me. I was still
        screaming, then suddenly the sounds of "fang and fury" ceased.
        The big black dog laid lifeless on the ground and Shep was down,
        bleeding badly. I climbed down out of the tree and ran as fast
        as my little legs could motor, back towards the farm house to
        get help. As I cleared the edge of the woods my Grandfather was
        running towards me. He had his twelve gauge shotgun in his
        hands. I blurted out " that Shep was down and hurt bad." He told
        me to go back to the house.<br>
        <br>
        A little later he returned carrying Shep in his arms like a
        little baby. Shep weighed a little over 100 lbs . He took Shep
        into the barn to patch-up his wounds. I watched as the wounds
        were washed and treated, listening to Grandfather talking to
        Shep. The rest of that month I slept in the barn with Shep on a
        pallet my Grandmother had fixed for me. Everyday I brought food
        and water until he recovered. Before falling to sleep, Shep and
        I would talk, I pretended that he answered me, because I knew he
        understood.<br>
        <br>
        During Shep's' convalescence the Veterinarian paid a visit to
        the farm to give Shep a Rabies shot and pick up the head of the
        vanquished big black dog which my Grandfather had severed
        earlier after the battle. So the Vet. could test it for Rabies.
        As Shep was recovering, we became the best of friends. Soon he
        was back to being his old self again. He was my partner in all I
        did in my make believe world. We would walk in the jungle, sail
        ships to far away places, and fight the pirates on the high seas
        and the bad guys of the Wild, Wild West. And take on the
        Martians with Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe). Making camp;
        building some make shift tents in all the fantasy places. Our
        two favourite stomping grounds was the Barn and a little Creek
        where we would go on a pretended "sea voyage" and explore an
        uncharted Island where hostile natives lived.<br>
        <br>
        The Barn was our Fort, our Castle and our Tree House in the
        Jungle. I had tied (well I had one of the giants to ...) two big
        ropes to the roof rafters: one was for swinging from one hay
        loft across a wide space to the hay loft on the other side of
        the barn. The other rope was an escape rope for when Shep and I
        were under attack from the Pirates or the Natives. It was
        attached to a large wooden beam outside the loft window that was
        used during the haying season to bring the hay up into the loft
        from the Hay Wagon. Under attack, I would jump out the window
        and catch hold of the rope and slid down to the ground. Shep
        would have to use the steps. We spent hours and hours in the
        barn. I loved to swing "a la Tarzan " back and forth between the
        lofts. Shep would watch for a while as I sailed back and forth
        but finally he would give up and lay down. Only now and then
        would he raise his head to see if I was still there.<br>
        <br>
        When the ropes were put up, my Grandfather never told
        Grandmother and he told me when I was through to make sure the
        ropes were secured so Grandmother could not see them which I
        always did. But one day I had just leaped out of the loft
        window. Shep and I had just been under attack by the pirates. My
        Grandmother rounded the corner about to enter the barn. Shep
        bounded out of the entrance at full speed barking his head off
        almost knocking Grandmother off her feet. She saw Shep standing
        near the end of the barn still barking, she had yet to see me.
        She yelled at Shep, he paid no attention, he was looking up at
        me. She didn't have her glasses on (praise be). Grandfather came
        out the back porch door to see what all the commotion was about,
        he saw me dangling in mid-air on the rope, he had helped me to
        secure for my jump-off. He saw Grandmother walking towards Shep.
        He called Shep, Shep stop barking and ran towards him.
        Grandmother turned and went into the barn. I dropped to the
        ground. Shep came running and we both took off for the woods.<br>
        <br>
        The Barn also had our secret hiding place. No one knew about it
        expect Shep and I. Most of the time it was Grandmother looking
        for us; a piece of pie was missing. If we were in our secret
        room and she entered the Barn, I would tell Shep to be real
        quiet. She never discovered us. About the pie; sometimes we
        would sneak into the kitchen and discover a lonely piece of pie
        just sitting there begging to be taken.So Shep and I would honor
        the request and take it back to our hiding place and have a
        snack. Shep really developed an apple pie weakness. Although
        come to think of&nbsp; it, he never turned down a piece of any
        of the other kinds of&nbsp;pies. It was days like this and all
        the other days of playing with Shep that fueled my active
        imagination and wonder about all and everything.<br>
        <br>
        Saturdays on the farm was usually a traveling day. Sometimes to
        Fillmore to visit or to Greencastle to shop and pick up needed
        supplies. But before we get to the particulars of Saturday, we
        need to back up one day to Friday. Friday night was one of my
        least favourite nights. Between one and ten, it rated a zero. It
        was "rub a dub, dub night, one boy in the tub night" with the
        Warden (Grandmother) standing watch as she delivered the lye
        soap, brush and towel. Now, I don't know if you have ever been
        scrubbed with"a real to goodness" thick bristled brush and lye
        soap. Well it's not a picnic or a stroll in the park. After the
        "rub a dub in the tub", the warden with her Magnifying Glass
        held inspection time. The ears and toes were the prime suspects.
        After I passed inspection it was off to beddy-bye because the
        next day was Saturday, my favorite day of days.<br>
        <br>
        The Fillmore Saturdays was a day for visiting my Uncles and
        Aunts, Nephew and Niece. My Uncle Ray and his wife had a son and
        daughter. Charlie was three years my senior (eight)and his
        sister was my age (five). On one of the visits, Charlie told me
        he was interested in girls and that he had a girlfriend. I
        couldn't understand how anyone could be interested in girls.
        They didn't hunt or fish or play ball. And they liked taking
        baths. How could you like taking a bath? And their hands were
        always clean. And they smelled like a rose bush, "aaagh!" They
        were indeed strange. I remembered telling Charlie that when I
        got older I wouldn't be interested in girls, never. But as they
        do say, "never say never".<br>
        <br>
        Because I remember as I got older, about six. I enjoyed playing
        doctor and patient. One day my curiosity "peeked", no, I didn't
        spell it wrong and "yes" I know it can be spelled "peaked". But
        I did peek and I did touch and the patient ran out of my office
        and told her Mother and my Grandmother. Later I received my
        first sex lecture. And was told and I do mean told by my
        Grandmother (who could quote the Bible, Chapter and Verse) that
        my behavior was not acceptable, 'no sir-ree Bob'. It was a "no,
        no". No look-ee, look-ee and certainly no touch-ee, touch-ee.
        She made me promise that I would not transgress again. And that
        God was watching me. I didn't quite understand how He could
        watch everybody. A little later I overheard my Father and
        Grandfather talking about my exploratory adventure. I only got
        bits and pieces of the conversation but it seemed that they were
        not as adamant about the incident as Grandmother. In fact there
        was a chuckle or two here and there which meant I was not going
        to be put on a 'bread and water' diet or sleep on a 'bed of
        nails'.<br>
        <br>
        Back to the Fillmore Saturday outings:<br>
        <br>
        Usually we switched back and forth: one Saturday we would have
        the noon meal at Uncle Ray's home, the next Saturday at Uncle
        Harrison's. Speaking of Uncle Harrison: I inherited the name
        'Harry' from him. Harry comes from Harrison My middle name 'Lee'
        came from a Great Grandfather on my Mother's side of the family.
        Lee comes from Leonard (Leo). Where was I? Oh, yes! The noon
        meals were special at both of my Uncles' homes. Each of their
        wives were excellent makers of pies and cakes. And both Uncles
        made special kinds of ice cream. Sometimes with different kinds
        of fruit mixed in or chunks of chocolate. It was yummy, yum
        time! And the ice cream was made with a new fangled ice cream
        maker that you didn't have to wear your arm in a sling the next
        day. You just plugged it in, no cranking necessary.<br>
        <br>
        Now our Saturday outings to Greencastle were "a horse of a
        different colour". Fillmore was a 'hoot and a holler' away from
        the farm, whereas Greencastle was three or four 'hoot and
        hollers 'away. Not only was Greencastle the County Seat of
        Putnam County, it was bigger and busier than Fillmore. There
        were Larger Feed Stores, Livery Stables, a bigger Post Office, a
        University (Depew). But my favourite building was the Movie
        House, a real to goodness Movie Theatre. Each Saturday the Movie
        started at 12:45 PM. And when we visited Greencastle, I was in
        the second row waiting for the curtain to open. My Grandfather
        always gave me two dimes, one for the ticket and the other for
        candy and popcorn. Twenty cents was a lot of money in the early
        1900's, you could buy a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk or
        two gallons of gasoline. I mentioned that I always sat in the
        second row in the Movie Theatre. For a long time, many years
        later I learned that the people in Hollywood weren't as odd
        looking as I thought they were with their big noses, big mouths,
        big heads and bodies all out of shape at times. Also, they
        didn't talk as loud.<br>
        <br>
        When the Curtain opened, the first thing to appear on the Screen
        was the 'Movie Tone News' or the 'Pathe News' Followed by the
        'March of Time' Narrated by 'Lowell Thomas'. Then came a Short
        Comedy: with"Joe Doaks, Behind the Eight Ball" or some other
        Comedy Skit with (Leon Errol or Edgar Kennedy). Maybe the 'Three
        Stooges" or "Our Gang" Then the Curtain would close and when it
        opened again , the Main Feature came on. Sometimes Cowboy Movies
        with (Tom Mix, Buck Jones, Lash La Rue , Hop A Long Cassidy,
        Bill Elliot, or the Cisco Kid.) maybe a Pirate movie or A
        Mystery movie. And let's not forget the Tarzan Movies, my
        favourite. After the main feature was through then came the
        Cartoon ( Felix The Cat, Popeye or Mickey Mouse and Pluto) Then,
        what every kid had been waiting for all week, the ongoing
        Saturday Afternoon Serial with its' 'cliff hanging' endings
        which brought you back each Saturday to see if the hero escape
        his almost certain doom the week before. Like, 'Flash Gordon (
        Buster Crabbe) And The Martians'. Each week, Flash Gordon
        escaped the most impossible impending disasters that were
        certain to spell his doom. But like all the Heroes of the
        Saturday Afternoon Serials, he was saved just in the nick of
        time. To live and fight, yet another day against the Evil forces
        of the World. Such was the life of the Hero, who ever he might
        be or where ever he might be.<br>
        <br>
        Sorry for the aside:<br>
        <br>
        As long as we are on the subject of Saturday trips; I need to
        talk about a Special Surprise Trip. One Friday night while I was
        "rub-a-dub" scrubbing, my Grandmother told me that we would be
        leaving a little bit earlier come Saturday morning. We were
        going on a special visit. I ask; where? Her reply was" You will
        have to wait and see". I couldn't fall asleep that night from
        thinking about where we might be going. Maybe to Indianapolis or
        Terra Haute, but why were we going? When morning came I was up
        and dressed waiting to hear; "Harry Lee, it is time to get up".
        Shep and I were down the stairs, bounding into the kitchen.
        "Land of goshens!" did you sleep in you clothes last night,
        son." "No!" just excited and made sure I would be ready on
        time". After breakfast, we piled into the Ford and away we went.
        The road was not familiar. I tried to find out where we were
        going but both Grandparents acted as though they had a banana in
        each ear. In fact my Grandfather said; turning to grandmother,
        "did you hear an echo?" I am sure I heard a voice". "Did you
        hear a voice Harry Lee?" "Sure did, it was me". "Sally, did you
        hear Harry Lee?" "No, is he here?" "Come on, both of you are
        fool'in with me." "Okay! said Grandfather, we are going to
        Evansville ". ( Evansville was the second largest City in
        Indiana ), I had never been there before.) Not too far outside
        the City the traffic was increasing. Small Stores started
        showing up along the way. Grandfather said in another ten
        minutes or so, we would be in the centre of town. Then a big
        overhead arch came in view; "Welcome to Evansville ".<br>
        <br>
        Well, it was big, big compared with Fillmore and Greencastle and
        with so many cars and stores. We pulled up in front of a big
        Church that had some statues out in front. One of the statues
        looked like it had a person stuck to it. I asked Grandfather,
        and he said that it was a Catholic Statue and that the Church
        was a Catholic Church. I didn't have a clue as to what he was
        talking about. Grandmother was silent all this time. Suddenly,
        she said; "the people who go this Church are Idol Worshipers;
        they have Statues all over, outside, and inside the Church.
        They're heathens!" Again, I didn't know what all the words
        meant. Finally Grandfather said; "now Sally, that's enough the
        boy doesn't understand. Let's drop it." Well, we got out of the
        Truck and started heading towards a huge store. The Store was
        the "Sears and Roebuck Catalogue Store", over the entrance to
        the Store there was a sign that read; "Welcome to Evansville's'
        "Wishing Well Store" (It was the sixth Sears and Roebuck Store
        in America, built in 1925) It was that and much, much more. Most
        of the time my mouth was "open", I had that farm boy look and
        the words to go with it. Like "golly" and fifty or more
        "golly's". And when we got to the "Toy World" floor, I was out
        of "gollies". The new word was "gee whiz". I had never seen so
        many toys gathered together in one place. If I could have I
        would have stay there; as they do say on the farm, "Until the
        cows come home". The sign was right it was indeed a "Wishing
        Store" What a day! What a day! My first visit to a "Sears and
        Roebuck Store"<br>
        <br>
        Wishes do come true on those special days; Birthdays,
        Anniversaries, Graduations, Valentine Days Easter and Christmas.
        And even those plain old days when someone just decides to give
        a Gift to that special person.<br>
        <br>
        For me 'Sears and Roebuck' (which is now called just 'Sears')
        was the biggest, the grandest Store in the whole wide World. I
        could have spent all day just wandering around like a lost lamb.
        It truly was a 'Wonderland', so many things to see. On each
        floor I would see, what I had never seen before, much of what I
        saw, I didn't even know the' name or what it was for.<br>
        <br>
        The icing on the cake was when my Grandfather stood in a long
        line to get the new "Wish book", the "Sears and Roebuck
        Catalogue". The Catalogue had pictures of everything under the
        roof of the Wonder Store. And if they didn't have it in stock,
        you could order it and it would be mailed or shipped to you. It
        was an A to Z Store. You could even order a Model T Ford car or
        truck (cost about $600.00 to $800.00) the year of my birth, the
        Ford Automobile Company production of the Model T reached 15
        million. Mr Ford surely didn't have to worry about the price of
        his next cup of coffee, that's if he drank coffee.<br>
        <br>
        No one will ever know; how many families across America spent
        their time thumbing through the pages of this 'Wish Book' for
        that special something. In the early years of the 20th.Century
        the "Sears and Roebuck Catalogue" was in more Farmland homes
        than the 'Farmers' Almanac', second only to the 'Bible' to be
        found on a table in the Parlor or on a table in the kitchen. And
        last years' edition could be found in the two seaters about
        fifty steps out back, past the corn shed.<br>
        <br>
        Well, as I promised let's return to the 'Shores of Heartaches'
        and those trying times that reached Number one on the 'Misery
        Charts'. To resurrect the unpleasant that has been buried and
        dead for such a long, long time which is not my favourite
        pastime. Nor am I overjoyed with the prospect of remembering the
        needless negative sides and the frailty of 'Human Nature'.<br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, here goes!<br>
        <br>
        One day my Mother came up to my room to wake me up and said that
        we were going to Greencastle as soon as I got dressed. She
        picked out the clothes I was to wear. They were my 'Sunday go to
        meeting clothes' but it wasn't Sunday. She helped me get ready
        and finished with combing my hair. Then we went downstairs. Her
        Father was outside, waiting for us in the car. On the way to
        Greencastle, my Mother's Father asked: "If I would like to stay
        at his house for awhile. I asked Mother if that would be
        alright. When I would visit him, he would let me play the
        'Player Piano'. in the parlor.There were so many tunes to pick
        from; sometimes I would play for a couple of hours.<br>
        <br>
        We got into Greencastle and pulled up in front of a big building
        with a lot of steps. As we got out another car pulled up and a
        man, I had never seen before got out and started walking towards
        us. My Mother and her Father talked to him as we walked up the
        steps of the big building. When we entered, I saw my two Uncles
        and their wives. I started to run over and talk to them but my
        Mother held on to me and said, "No". And I didn't know why?
        Shortly afterwards, my Grandfather, Grandmother and my Father
        entered with another man. I asked if I could go over and say
        "hello" again another "no".<br>
        <br>
        Just then a big door opened and everybody filed in to a very
        large room with a lot of seats. Everybody got seated and three
        new people entered the room from a door towards the front of the
        room beside a big desk. One was a man wearing a black robe like
        the Preacher sometimes wore. Following him was a lady who took a
        seat at a small table in front of the big desk. The third person
        looks like he had on some sort of a uniform. After the man in
        the black robe was seated, the uniformed man said "will all
        rise. The Honourable Judge "Somebody" will preside. "Please be
        seated now!" The man in black banged what looked like a hammer
        on the big desk and said:" This Court is now in session"<br>
        <br>
        My Mother's victory in winning the Divorce Settlement and my
        Custody was a bittersweet victory. The aftershock of the loss
        and separation caused a fallout of despair and disappointment
        for my Grandparents and my Father. But for my Grandmother the
        Courts' decision was especially devastating. Out of the hurt and
        pain, the contempt and scorn she had for my Mother increased
        tenfold that day. She fervently believed her ex-daughter-in-law
        had stolen her Grandson away, as she had stolen the heart of her
        son. What do they say about a woman's' scorn? Something to the
        effect; "never underestimate it".<br>
        <br>
        Well it had been underestimated, Eight months from the date that
        my Mother was awarded Custody of me. It was back to Court again.
        The players were the same, the setting was the same but the
        results were to be different. The Lawyer for my Grandfather had
        been a "busy little bee"; charges for child neglect had been
        filed. In effect that my Mother was living with a man which she
        was not married too. And that her life style was detrimental and
        inappropriate for my well being. During the trial; witnesses
        came forth to testify about the wild drinking parties, where the
        Police had to be called. Also photographs taken by a Detective
        Agency which my Grandfather had hired were introduced as
        evidence to collaborate some of the witnesses' testimonies.<br>
        <br>
        The conclusion of it all; the Court ruled in favour of my
        Grandparents and the "ping pong" ball (that's me) returned to
        the farm.<br>
        <br>
        The Court had awarded my Mother visiting privileges and a two
        weeks stay during the summers. At first my Mother visited
        monthly and the first summer I spent two weeks in Indianapolis
        and it was great. I did so many new and different things but
        there were complications. The monthly visits to the farm to pick
        me up usually ended up in a verbal battle between my Grandmother
        and my Mother. Words were said that should have never been said
        in my presence. Some of the words I had heard before and after
        the Courts' hearing. Also I had overheard my Grandmothers' wrath
        directed at my Mother, when she was on the phone or in
        conversations with some of her friends. They do say; (little
        pitchers have big ears). I guess mine were exceptionally big.<br>
        <br>
        Let me backtrack in time for a moment to my first summer visit
        to Indianapolis . As I mentioned, there were so many new things
        to see and do. I saw my first "Barnum and Bailey Ringling Bro's"
        Circus. My very first trip to the Riverside Amusement Park "
        with all the rides; the Merry-Go-Round, the Ferris wheel and the
        "Roller Coaster", the boat ride through the "Tunnel of Horrors",
        The "Crazy Mirror House". And let's not forget, the Cotton Candy
        and the Hot Dogs. Also the 'Big (stuffed) Mickey Mouse' the man
        with my Mother won for me.<br>
        <br>
        I visited the Zoo, went to the Movies in a big, big Theatre and
        saw a Stage Show with dancers, jugglers, trained dogs and even a
        Magician. We had lunch and sometimes dinner in big Restaurants.
        Afterwards shopping with My Mother to buy some new clothes.
        Everything was great! Then the "roof fell in".<br>
        <br>
        My Father and Grandmother showed up at my Mother's apartment
        without any notice one day. I had just gotten up from a nap. My
        Mother had gone out to do some shopping. The man, my Mother was
        living with and another lady was in the apartment alone when the
        door bell rang. The young lady opened the door and guess who?
        Father and my Grandmother. The young lady didn't know who they
        were and they didn't know who she was. Grandmother asked if this
        was where Martha Glidewell lived and the young lady said "yes"
        but she wasn't home at the moment. My Mother's boyfriend went to
        the door and asked who they were and what they wanted? My
        Grandmother asked "who he"? and where was Martha? "You were told
        she is not here". The tone of his reply was not acceptable to my
        Grandmother.<br>
        <br>
        Let's run the clock back just a little. When the door bell rang,
        I jump out of bed and started running down the hall towards the
        door to see who it was. The young lady came out of the other
        bedroom, stopped me and said; "go back to your room and shut the
        door" which I did. I heard muffled voices but I could not
        understand what was being said or by who. Then shortly, I heard
        my name called then I knew it was Grandmother. I came out of the
        bedroom and ran into the living room. There was Grandmother,
        Father, the young lady and the boyfriend. The young lady was in
        her bra and panties. And the man was standing there in his
        underwear. Grandmother was slowly turning red from the neck up.
        Like a rising thermometer ready to explode which it did. She was
        telling the man and the lady a "what for" in no uncertain terms.
        A real live "Here comes the Judge with the judgement" with a
        rapier tongue delivery.<br>
        <br>
        The door bell rang. Round one was over but round two was about
        to begin. In walks my Mother with an arm full of groceries.
        Words, many words flew back and forth. The voice levels ranged
        from loud to loud. Sparks were flying and eyes were flashing,
        accusations and counter accusations. Every once an awhile, the
        words Jezebel, Hussy, Harlot and Slut surfaced. I was there but
        not there, I had become invisible during the fray. Suddenly, I
        yelled at the top of my lungs. I became visible, I ran to my
        Mother, crying as I ran. A hush fell along with the words. There
        was only silence.<br>
        <br>
        That day died slowly and painfully but it was finally buried
        down deep, very deep. Others were to follow. Nor did I know that
        this "Black Day" would rise from its burial place in the future.<br>
        <br>
        After that first tragic summer visit my Mother's monthly
        visitations stopped as did any summer visits. I never knew the
        reasons why, until several years later. But my Mother's decision
        was all that my Grandmother needed to strengthen her constant
        barrage of remarks about my mother's lifestyle and her
        character. Later, I will return and write about my Mother and
        our relationship down through the years, the good and the not so
        good.<br>
        <br>
        Let's return to the days between my fourth and seventh birthday.
        Around the age of four was the beginning of my helping around
        the farm. I had specific daily chores to do. Like feeding the
        chickens and the ducks, making sure that they had plenty of
        water. After the the collecting of their eggs, I brought in the
        wood from the wood pile. for the big iron kitchen stove, the
        potbelly stove in the parlor and the fireplace<br>
        <br>
        Now and then, I would tend to the big compost pile used for
        fertilizing Grandmother's prize rose bushes. Feeding the
        chickens and the ducks was an easy task. But the collecting of
        the eggs from the hen house started out with a few problems. The
        hens had their nests higher than my reach which meant I had to
        get a little stool to stand on to get the eggs. Now if the hens
        had left their nests in the morning and the eggs were just
        laying there waiting for me to put them in my basket, no
        problem. But the problem came when a sitting hen didn't want to
        be disturbed. Now we have a situation. Especially when you are
        only knee-high to a grasshopper (cricket that is) and the mamma
        hen has gotten up on the wrong side of the nest. You are in
        deep, deep trouble, yes, you are<br>
        <br>
        My first bout with a stubborn 'cluck, cluck' ended in an
        embrassing disaster. Early one morning my Grandmother needed
        some fresh eggs. Foolishly I said; I'll go get some. With my
        little yellow&nbsp;basket in hand, I entered the hen house and
        started collecting some eggs. I had collected about ten or so
        and was on my way out the door when I noticed a very large nest
        occupied by a very large pile of feathers that was clucking
        away. I got my stool and placed it in front of the nest. I
        climbed up and was 'eyeball to eyeball' with a big squawking
        mamma hen. The minute I put my hand into the nest grabbing for
        an egg, she took off like a 747 and circled the roost. The stool
        was wobbling, I was wobbling and then she landed on top of my
        head with her clawed landing gear. I let out a "whoop and a
        hollar" that would have raised the dead. As I fell backwards,
        the collected eggs were launched and orbiting just above me as I
        landed on my backsides. Just then my Grandfather rushed into the
        hen house, the orbiting eggs came in for a soft landing, all
        over me. My Grandfather burst into a chorus of booming laughter.
        The audience increased as my Grandmother appeared and the
        laughter became a duet. And then Shep appeared, if he had made
        it a trio. I would have thrown the one remaining egg that had
        not broken at him. To say the least I was not a "happy camper".
        From that day on as I collected the eggs, I carried a little
        stick. If a hen was stubborn, I would give it a slight nudge and
        a tap on the beck after that no problem.<br>
        <br>
        My Grandfather told that story about the "Egg Caper", at least a
        hundred times or more always ending up by clapping his hands. I
        never knew if he was applauding his skill of story telling or my
        performance as an egg collector. His quaint final line was; the
        "yolk was on Harry Lee". 'Henny Youngman' would have no doubt
        enjoyed that one liner. For the uninitiated, Mr. Youngman was
        the King of the one liners' comedy. One of his favorite one
        liner was; "Who was that woman I saw you with last night. And he
        would reply; "that was no woman that was my wife".<br>
        <br>
        After feeding all the feathered friends in the early part of the
        morning and I do mean early; the farm day started at five in the
        morning. The first one to stir, was my Grandmother. She would be
        in the kitchen firing up the big iron stove and starting
        breakfast preparations. Next one up was Grandfather then my
        Father with myself bringing up the rear around 6:30 am. But
        before I arrived on the scene, my two Uncles had arrived and
        joined my Grandfather and Father in the milking shed. My bedroom
        was up a stair step ladder into the attic which had a finished
        floor and plenty of room. My bed and shif-robe that held all my
        clothes had a partitioned off space to the front of the
        farmhouse with a big window looking out across the farm. My
        buddy "Shep" shared the bedroom with me; he slept at the foot of
        the bed. Each morning I heard the morning crew getting up and
        when my Uncles arrived for the morning milking. On a cold winter
        morning it was difficult climbing out from under a big feathered
        comforter to scurry down to the kitchen that was nice and warm.
        But awaiting me was a big cup of hot chocolate with a
        marshmallow floating on top. After I had finished drinking the
        chocolate I would go and feed the chickens and the ducks.
        Sometimes I would go into the milking shed where the cows were
        being relieved of their bounty. Grandfather would say; "open
        your mouth Harry Lee", he would then squirt some warm milk into
        my mouth straight from the udder, his aim was 'right on the
        money'.<br>
        <br>
        After the earlier chores were finished it was breakfast time
        (about 7:30 am.). Now breakfast time on the farm was the most
        important meal of the day. You haven't had a breakfast until you
        have sat down to a home cooked morning spread on the farm. And I
        do mean a spread; sausages, ham and bacon, eggs, (fried,
        scrambled or boiled), hot biscuits with milk gravy with bits of
        sausage sprinkled in, buttered pancakes with syrup or honey,
        fried potatoes, cottage cheese mixed with sweet molasses. A meal
        fit for "Old King Cole". After all the&nbsp;"merry
        old&nbsp;souls" had finished&nbsp;the morning breakfast and the
        table cleared. Morning chores resumed, my next chore was
        the&nbsp;'wood detail'<br>
        <br>
        The wood shed was located along side of the barn where the
        chords of wood were all stacked. The sawing and the splitting of
        the wood into smaller sizes to fit the two stoves and the
        fireplace was done by the giants (Grandfather and sons). The
        saw, axe and hatchet was off limits for me. Of course when no
        one was looking I would sneak in a couple private whacks with
        the hatchet, now and then, hardly denting the wood log. When I
        saw the giants do it, the axe or the hatchet would sink deep
        into the wood and the chips would fly. When I did it , the
        hatchet would keep bouncing out. I wouldn't have been mistaken
        for Paul Bunyan or any other woodsman. I used the Stagecoach to
        haul the wood up to the back porch. It really wasn't a
        Stagecoach it was my wagon. When Shep and I would play cowboy
        and outlaws, the wagon became a Stagecoach. You know like the
        pumpkin in the Cinderella Story became the Coach. Shep and I
        bypassed the Fairy-godmother. Well anyway I would pile a half
        dozen small chunks of wood into the wagon. Then Shep and I would
        haul the wood to the back door. Then Shep would lay down and
        wait for me to unload the wagon. I think it was against the
        doggie union to go beyond the hauling. After the three wood
        boxes were filled which took a trillion steps or so it seemed.
        As they do say: " I was plum tuckered out" come noon.<br>
        <br>
        In the Summer there was but one wood box to fill, the wood for
        the huge iron cast stove in the kitchen, my Grandmother's pride
        and joy. But come Winter when all three wood boxes had to be
        filled. I got some help from the giants I lived among. My
        Grandfather, Father and two Uncles were all over six feet tall,
        when they chipped in and helped it was "chop, chop", they filled
        the model T truck, drove it up to back porch door and filled up
        all the wood boxes in record time. Since I mentioned the four
        giants; my grandfather was the larger of all three sons and
        could work all three of them into the ground. Seldom would
        Grandfather take off his shirt during the day, except in the
        summer when he would take a trip to the well-pump to cool off.
        It was then you could see his well structured muscular
        definition. He was a man in his late eighties but his physical
        appearance said he was in his forties. No one could ever guess
        his age, his hair was only slightly grey and no sign of loss of
        hair. His strength could match any of his sons and more. Even
        Uncle Harrison who could pick up a hundred pound bail of hay and
        toss it into the back of the truck with little or no effort.<br>
        <br>
        A story was told about an incident where a friend of
        Grandfather's got into an argument at a Feed store. He and his
        friend were talking to the owner. And in walks another man that
        started yelling obscenities at Grandfather's friend, falsely
        accusing him. The owner and my Grandfather tried to quiet the
        enraged man to no avail. Suddenly everything got out of hand and
        the man pulled out a pistol and at the same time "yelled: "you
        are all against me." He leveled the gun, my Grand father grabbed
        his wrist and broke every bone in the wrist. The gun never
        fired. One of the feats Grandfather would do if ever you could
        get him to do it. He would take a silver dollar and bend it into
        a u-shape, His fingers were like steel chords.<br>
        <br>
        I have mentioned the big cast iron stove in the kitchen several
        times. So let's talk about this Modern Marvel of the early 20th.
        Century. It took up a good part of one wall in the kitchen with
        its' chimney vent and wood box. It had a famous brand name (
        which has momentarily left my mind) and it was the biggest Stove
        they made. You could load it with wood from both sides and also
        clean out the grating from both sides. The top was large enough
        to boil eight pots of water at one time. The oven was two tiered
        with removable shelves. With the shelves out it was big enough
        to roast a good size pig. Out of the mouth of that oven with the
        help of my Grandmother's culinary expertise came all the mouth
        watering yummy, yums. Delicious pies; (apple, cherry, peach,
        blueberry, rhubarb, pecan, walnut, pumpkin and mince meat).
        Apple Strudel, candied cover apples on a stick, doughnuts. Then
        all the cakes; (pound cake, angel food cakes, dark chocolate,
        white marble cake and cup cakes). And then this 'Great Horn of
        Plenty' Oven would offer up The Christmas and Thanksgiving
        Turkeys and Honeyed Hams with all the Seasons trimmings. The
        Wizard of the Kitchen was my Grandmother. She planned and cooked
        for all occasions and events. Every season had its' special
        foods.<br>
        <br>
        The occasions were many and varied; there was the canning season
        that came in the Fall, along with the Spring slaughtering time
        of several annual pigs and a cow. There was the Wheat Harvesting
        Times, the Corn Shucking Bee's, The Barn Raisings, the Church
        Socials and the cooking preparation when the Annual County Fair
        happened. Let's say a few words about several of these events
        before we get to talking about Thanksgivings and Christmas,
        okay!<br>
        <br>
        The 'Canning Season' after the Fall harvest was always a big
        event. As in the earlier history of the human species, the
        gathers and the hunters came together. Only now in the early
        20th. century, the farmers, their wives and children replaced
        the 'gathers and the hunters'. The farming community came
        together in a co-op spirit moving from field to field, farmhouse
        to farmhouse in the harvesting and the preparation of storing
        food for the long winter ahead. Most every farm had their "root
        cellars" and their "smoke houses" that had to be filled to last
        out the winter months. Most root cellars were attached to the
        main farm house via an underground passage way to the
        underground cellar. Although some were situated apart from the
        farmhouse. This below the ground cellar, along with the freezing
        winter weather helped in the preserving of all the fruits and
        vegetables sealed in the hundreds of glass jars that lined the
        walls of this primitive " Refrigerator". (a note to be added)
        Since potatoes are as important to the native North American, as
        rice is to the Chinese. The American farmer would bury the
        harvested potatoes in huge mounds of dirt for the coming winter
        freezes, another primitive but an effective way of preserving
        food until needed.<br>
        <br>
        The ladies of the community would come together during the
        harvesting of the wheat, the fruit and the vegetables. Moving
        from farm to farm to help in the gathering and the preparation
        of the food for the canning process. The famous brand of glass
        preserving jars were called; "Ball Jars". I would grab a couple
        to store my marbles in along with my "Jacks,"and "Tidily-Winks"
        also one to keep the fireflies in.<br>
        <br>
        Grandmother's kitchen would become a food processing plant;
        large pots to make the paraffin to seal in the contents of the
        jars, The sterilizing of the jars, the preparation of the
        veggies, the fruits. It was "chop, chop", "boil, boil " "cook,
        cook" time. Now, during all this 'busy bee' stuff in the
        kitchen. The hunters, excuse me!, the husbands were as about as
        useless, as the "Wooden Indian" that stood outside the Feed
        Store. This season and the get togethers was a fun time for the
        children. We would play tag, blind mans' bluff, hide-in-seek,
        ring around the rosy, cowboys and Indians, have tug-a-wars,
        pitch washers or horse-shoes, dodge-ball, chase the girls and go
        down to the small creek and catch tadpoles and frogs. Some of
        these would somehow find there way in the girls
        blouses.&nbsp;But our favorite of favourites was when dinner
        came (mid-day meal) along with the deserts brought in by all the
        wives.<br>
        <br>
        After the dinner was cleared;&nbsp;there would be different
        contests and games; Burlap bag races, where two people would
        step into a large bag together and&nbsp;race another couple by
        hopping together to the finish line. Usually it was with one
        adult and a young person together in the bag. And then there was
        the egg toss; two people would stand three feet apart and then
        toss an uncooked egg back and forth. After both had caught the
        egg at that distance, the distance was increased another three
        feet and the eggs were tossed again. The increasing and the
        catching went on until the eggs were broken or missed. The last
        couple who were the furthest apart without breaking their egg
        won. There were also Horseshoe pitching contests, Arm Wrestling,
        Hay Bail tossing, the Cow Chip tossing&nbsp;and Wood Chopping
        Contests.<br>
        <br>
        I mentioned earlier about Uncle Harrison throwing bails of hay
        into the back end of the farm truck. Well during the Hay Bail
        throwing Contest for distance. Three men were still in the
        running, Uncle Harrison, a neighbouring farm hand and the man
        who had won it last year and the year before. Uncle Harrison
        threw first, the throw measured an extra two an a half inches.
        The farm hand made his throw, it landed a half of an inch shy of
        Uncle Harrison's throw. Last years' Champion stepped up to make
        his throw. He reached down and shouldered the bail behind his
        neck and hurled it into the air, you could have heard a pin drop
        as the bail dropped. The Judges ran out to measure. It was a
        tie. Both men just stared at each other. Each knowing a tiring
        of the muscles. They had been lifting and throwing a hundred
        pound bail of hay for thirty minutes. After a little rest and
        some water the next toss was up. The Champion would go first, he
        looked at my Uncle Harrison as he stood there ready to reach
        down for the bail of hay. A slight smile broke as he grabbed and
        took hold and threw the bail of hay into the air, not a whisper
        could be heard, only the thud of the bail as it landed. The
        gathering applauded the throw it was longer than his last throw.
        The 'moment of truth' had arrived for my Uncle Harrison. He had
        been in this spot before, history was repeating itself. The last
        two years, he had faced the Champion and lost. He had watched
        the throw of the Champion, it was seemingly an impossible throw.
        It was four inches longer than his last throw. Where did this
        man get this flow of strength this late in the game. Then he
        remember the first time he saw that slight smile. It was when he
        won the High School State Regional Wrestling Championship. Now
        as then. it was do or defeat. He reached down in one motion, the
        bail was up, up and away. It landed two inches beyond the
        Champions' throw. The crowd was speechless for only a moment
        then it burst forth in congratulations.<br>
        <br>
        The Champion walked over, pause a moment then put out his hand
        and said; "well done son! You done good!" Again that slight
        smile. Uncle Harrison never tired in the telling of that day.
        The day when he finally took down the Champion. And I never
        tired in the hearing of it. The last time I heard him mention,
        what he used to refer to as his most 'Memorable Day' was when he
        spoke; at Grandfather's Funeral.<br>
        <br>
        One of the virtues of the rural farm life in the early 1900,s
        was the supportive community spirit. When things were not going
        so well for one of the neighbours what ever the problem might be
        the neighbours were there to help. Come what may, the helping
        hand was always extended. Out of this neighbourly concern came
        the Barn raisings or the Shucking Bees to get the corn in before
        the Winter approached. Then there was the shared labor and
        machinery to help in the Wheat Harvesting.<br>
        <br>
        The Steel Wheeled Tractor, the Wheat Thrashing Machines and the
        Combines appeared in the late 1800's. They were expensive
        sometimes to expensive for an individual but they were great
        labor and time savers. They could do the work of ten horses and
        ten men in half the time or less. So Communities all over
        America would form 'Co-Op' ventures; coming together to buy the
        needed machinery and move from one farm to another during the
        ploughing, planting and gathering. It allowed more acreage to be
        prepared, seeded and harvested. About the same time the American
        Urban Culture decided that Toast for breakfast was the going
        thing after the Electric Toaster became a landslide sales item
        in&nbsp;all the Stores across a America . More Toasters, more
        wheat needed (supply and demand). The name of the Game!<br>
        <br>
        Well during all this " Ploughing, Planting, Shucking, Thrashing
        and Gathering; the Community 'Get-togethers' increased tenfold,
        as did the "After the Event Spreads' of Food, Along with the
        Games, the Fiddle, Banjo and Square Dancing, where you "held and
        touch". And "walked your baby back home" that's what they do
        say. With all this "touchee, touchee" and "dozee doe-ing." And
        the 'now and then' sound of the shuffling of cards, accompanied
        with a sip and a swallow 'here and there' of the lemonade that
        someone had conveniently spiked. Then added to all the above;
        that strange custom of smoking a crushed tobacco leaf. This was
        the last leaf (straw I mean.) for my Grandmother since she was a
        card carrying "Hard-shelled Baptist". all these kinds of going
        on's was a "No, No." and I do mean a "No, No".<br>
        <br>
        Roughly translated, a "hard-shelled Baptist" means from time to
        time, hard-headed or persistently stubborn, a no-nonsense Bible
        pounding, slain in the Spirit, literalist. There were some
        "Shells" who believed that St. Peter took dictation and type set
        the 'Holy Writ'. Later it was printed and published in the "Holy
        Roller Print Shop owned by King James, located just outside the
        "Pearly Gates". In between the Shop that re-feathered tattered
        and broken wings and the "Golden Harp Shop" where they sold New
        and Used Harps. And much, much later the Bibles were distributed
        by "Preachers", there's that word again. The Bibles were called
        the "King James" Bible to give free advertisement to the Print
        Shoppe. How about that!, a business minded King.<br>
        <br>
        Now the "Preacher", that's what they do call them. Because
        someone would shout "Hey, Preacher!" Or the Preacher is coming;
        you better put out that cigar and hid the booze. Or here comes
        the Preacher go put the Bible on the table in the parlor and
        make sure that it is open. The story goes that when the first
        male Baptist was born in America . The Baptist mid-wife told the
        Mother and Father, your son the Preacher weighed in at ten
        pounds. And the wife turned to the husband and said; "dear, did
        you hear what she said; we have baby Preacher, isn't that
        divine? But what is a Preacher?<br>
        <br>
        Well a Preacher, the Rev., a Jesus Cowboy of the Holy Ghost
        Corral, a member of the God Squad, has been called by many names
        and also called a few other names from time to time. Some say
        that&nbsp;they are just "called". A Famous One by the name of
        Pauly received a long, a very long distance call and he fell off
        of his horse or was that a jackass? Anyway upon awaking a Voice
        said; "you're a Preacher." And he do say; "not me!" And then
        Pauly asks; what is a "Preacher?" I told you some of those
        Baptists are literalist, every dot and tittle.<br>
        <br>
        Of course all this is obviously hearsay. Not worth a "wooden
        nickel". Any one believing any of this needs to be careful
        because there are some men wearing white coats, carrying a
        tailored straight-jacket that says on it : Property of the
        "Funny Farm". And they just might be looking for you. (Just
        having a little fun, folks!)<br>
        <br>
        Well enough levity for the moment. Let's resume this memory romp
        of yesteryear. And speak about Christmas time down on the farm
        in the late twenties. As most know Christmas is a healing time.
        The wounds of the year seemingly disappear during this festive
        season. All the hurts, the misgivings take flight as the "Spirit
        of Christmas" soothes and forgives many of our human frailties
        that surface from time to time. The less human become more
        humane, the unforgiving more forgiving, the less compassionate
        more compassionate, the selfish more selfless, the unloving the
        more loving. "Peace and goodwill" are on the lips of most, even
        on some of those harbingers of doom and gloom.<br>
        <br>
        Christmas is that wonderful magical time for the very young and
        the young at heart. In their eyes and heart, the World becomes a
        Winter Wonderland as anticipation fills the air. T'is the time
        when dreams and wishes are wrapped around about with thoughts of
        sugar plums, peppermint canes and candied apples, hard rock
        candy, candle lights, tinsel and mistletoe. And let's not forget
        the red suited man's "Ho Ho! and a Merry Christmas to one and
        all"<br>
        <br>
        And yes, this was even so in those years when America was
        brought to her knees. The 'Christmas Spirit' was alive and
        kicking in the stark face of scarcity and adversity. For you
        see, in the eyes of a child. Christmas is always Christmas. Come
        what may!<br>
        <br>
        My Christmas's on the farm hold great memories for me. And I
        have often wondered, why? Why I remember them over much later
        ones. Possibly it was because I felt they were pure and simple,
        no excessive frills or superficiality. They were more personal
        in the sense that all the preparation was a do-it-yourself
        Christmas, every body creating and doing. a giving of
        themselves. It was not an "out of the can" Christmas. The days
        leading up to Christmas and Christmas itself&nbsp;was surrounded
        by lots of affectionate caring. You could not go to the store
        and buy this kind of Christmas. It was truly home-grown.<br>
        <br>
        Right after Thanksgiving,Grandmother was preparing for the
        coming Christmas season. Actually she had been preparing all
        year. She saved and collected everything imaginable; bits and
        pieces of string, ribbons and bows, tinfoil all sizes and shapes
        of containers scrape of cloth and fabric, wrapping paper and
        cotton. You name it she save it. And she knew where all of it
        was. There were two of the items out of her collection of "this
        and that" that fascinated me; one was a ball of twine and string
        about the size of a fat balloon. And the second object was about
        the same size. It was made up of tinfoil that she had gathered
        from the tinfoil wrappers of gum. And from the inside of
        cigarette packs that were lined with tinfoil. Grandfather did
        not smoke but my two Uncles and my Father smoked like chimneys.
        Much to the chagrin of my Grandmother! String, ribbon, bows,
        cotton and tinfoil were indispensable for trimming the the
        family Christmas tree.<br>
        <br>
        The day for the Christmas tree selection was a fun day for me.
        Before I was six years old, Grandfather and one of my Uncles
        would tramp through the woods and chop down a suitable tree for
        the front parlor. But the year I turned six, I was part of the
        Christmas tree Brigade. On that day, my Grandfather and Uncle
        Harrison and a new member of the team (me) piled into the Ford
        truck and headed out on the Christmas tree quest. I was bursting
        at the seams with pride, here I was with the giants. "A hunting
        we will go, a hunting we will go. Hi, ho the Merry-O, a hunting
        we will go." (just a little ditty folks). We reached the spot;
        Grandfather parked the "tin lizzy" just inside the gate of the
        woods we were going to enter. He said that the snow drifts
        further in were too bad. Grandfather had spotted the perfect
        tree during the autumn months and he had kept his eye on it
        during his squirrel hunting time. Of course a walk in the woods
        anytime was always a good time to put meat on the table. And
        this time was no exception. As they do say; "if you can get two
        birds with one stone" (you've done good). Two twenty-two rifles
        laid side by side along with the axe, hatchet and a cross-cut
        saw in the back of the truck.<br>
        <br>
        Prior to entering the woods Grandfather told me to try to walk
        in his footsteps through the deep snow and that Uncle Harrison
        would follow behind in case I fell. Guess what? I did just that,
        along with some stumbling, slipping and sliding. But when I did
        fall Uncle Harrison would reach down with one hand and set me
        upright like a bowling pin. And then I would try the next big
        step. It seems I was more horizontal than vertical. We stopped
        and Grandfather pointed, there it was; what a beautiful tree.
        Like Goldilocks said; "it was just right" for the front parlor.
        Uncle Harrison and Grandfather made quick work in falling the
        tree. They tied up the branches and wrapped it up in a burlap
        sheet. Then they shouldered the tree and headed back to the
        truck. Oh! I almost forgot Grandfather let me take the first
        whack at the base of the tree with the hatchet.<br>
        <br>
        After the tree was secured in the back of the pick-up it was
        time for Bugs Bunny "to head for the hills" because Grandfather
        and Uncle Harrison were no 'Elmer Fudds'. What they shot at,
        they hit. The rifles were loaded and off we went, except this
        time I was above the snow drifts riding high on the shoulders of
        my Uncle. Grandfather and Uncle Harrison took turns carrying me
        and shooting. One rabbit that Grand father had hit refused to
        stay down and started to leap. Grandfather had to reload. Uncle
        Harrison in one movement put me on the ground and shot the
        rabbit in mid-air. What a shot! Tom Mix could not have done it
        better. I forgot to mention the reason my Grandfather and my
        Uncle were using rifles instead of shotguns. After the game is
        shot with a shotgun, you have a lot of buckshot to clean out of
        your kill. A bullet in the head saves a lot of meat and a lot of
        work. I never knew who was the better shot. It would be a toss
        up between Grandfather and Uncle Harrison.<br>
        <br>
        After about an hour an a half, fifteen rabbits were in the
        burlap bag and we were homeward bound. The Christmas tree was
        unloaded; the burlap bag with the rabbits was put on the back
        porch. And we washed up for the noon-day meal that Grandmother
        had been preparing. We sat down, the prayer was offered. And I
        was just about to tell Grandmother about how I took the first
        whack to fall the Christmas tree.When she asked me to pass the
        butter dish, she said; young man your hands are still dirty. You
        need to go out on the backporch and wash them again. Well, they
        looked clean to me but you did not quibble with Grandmother.<br>
        <br>
        While I was rewashing my hands, there was a thumping and a
        thrashing sound behind me. Suddenly, one of the rabbits decided
        he was not dead. He popped out of the burlap bag, wild eyed and
        bushy-tailed heading straight for me. It seemed he was growing
        bigger and bigger by the second. I let out a "hoop and a
        hollar". Grandfather was already out the kitchen door. He
        grabbed a mop and clubbed the rabbit knocking it against the
        wall. (Bye, Bye Rabbit) For several nights after that ordeal, I
        had rabbit nightmares. A very big and I DO mean BIG rabbit was
        standing at the foot of my bed. And his name wasn't "Harvey
        ".The problem was Shep never saw him.<br>
        <br>
        That afternoon a tree stand was made for the Christmas tree,
        later it was brought into the parlor to be trimmed. The rest of
        the afternoon and in the evening after supper, the trimming
        began. Popcorn was being strung, along with the cranberries and
        marshmallows. When they were finished, we added them to the
        tree. Then there was the tying on of the many shaped Christmas
        cookies (toy soldiers, Santa Clauses, reindeer, angels, stars
        and gingerman) . Grandfather had made some thin tin cut outs
        (snow men,soldiers, sheep, toy drums, bugles, Christmas balls
        and angels). Some of these were covered with Grandmother's saved
        tinfoil and the others painted various colors. These also were
        tied and hung on the branches. There were Special candle holders
        for the tree which held the candles that we would light at
        night. The cotton that had been saved was stuck around the
        branches to simulate snow It was also used to trim the round
        oval red felt cloth that hid the base of the tree. One of
        Grandmother Favorites, a cardboard "Nativity" scene was placed
        at the bottom of the tree. When the trimming was finished, the
        last piece was added. Then Grandmother would say, "this is what
        Christmas is all about", as the Star was placed on top of the
        Tree. And we sang;" Oh! Little Town Of Bethlehem ." What a
        beautiful Christmas tree it was.<br>
        <br>
        During the seven days that the tree was up, Grandfather would
        say to Grand-mother; you know it looks like we missed a spot. An
        ornament or a Christmas' cookie needs to be added there. Finally
        after the third day it was evident that the 'Cookie Monster' was
        afoot. Grandmother would ask me if I had seen the 'Cookie
        Monster'. I would of course deny any knowledge of it's
        existence. In the seven days leading up to Christmas. I ate
        enough cookies, candy and pieces of pie and cake to last me for
        the next twelve months. And so did Shep. <br>
        <br>
        Come Christmas Eve. We would drive into Fillmore to attend the
        Christmas Eve Service at the Methodist Church where both of my
        Uncles' families attended. After the Service was over, all the
        Clan would go back to the farm and wait for Christmas Day to
        dawn. My Aunts brought all the food which they had prepared for
        the 'Big Feast' the following day.<br>
        <br>
        That night I wore my eyes out, opening and shutting them as I
        look at the clock every five minutes. To see if it was time to
        get up and sneak downstairs before everybody else got up. Shep
        just ignored my impatience. I don't recall when I finally fell
        asleep. But whenever it was I missed sneaking downstairs. When I
        awoke, Shep was licking my face. I knew that I had over slept. I
        bounced out of bed and hurried down the steps. As I entered the
        pallor, everybody was dressed and waiting, just standing there
        looking at the Christmas tree. Suddenly it hit me; all the
        Christmas presents under the tree were missing.<br>
        <br>
        I thought maybe I was having a bad dream. Everybody was so
        quiet. Grandfather was the first to speak; "sorry, Harry Lee the
        'Cookie Monster' came during the night and stole all the
        presents while we were sleeping". It had to be a dream because I
        was the 'Cookie Monster'. Then everybody burst into laughter as
        Uncle Ray and Uncle Harrison started bringing in the missing
        presents. My heart resumed its' rhythm. This had all been
        planned by Uncle Harrison when it was evident that I had somehow
        over slept. Uncle Harrison had sent Shep up to awaken me.<br>
        <br>
        Before the handing out and the opening of the presents,
        Grandmother made her annual pre-opening speech about being real
        careful in opening the presents so as to preserve the bows,
        ribbons and wrapping paper. Of course all knew if we violated
        Grandmother's edict. The penalty would be twenty lashes with a
        wet noodle (just kidding, folks). Most of my presents were
        clothes; Grandmother had knitted two sweaters for me with
        matching scarfs. I received even more clothes from my Uncles and
        Aunts. The three surprise gifts were held for last. The first
        one was from Uncle Ray and family. It was a large bag of marbles
        of many colors. Uncle Ray knew how much I enjoyed shooting
        marbles. The second gift was from Uncle Harrison and Aunt
        Mildred, it was five new Flash Gordan comic books and a Flash
        Gordon Space Gun that fired sparks. The third surprise gift was
        from Grandfather and Father, a Red Rider Air pellet&nbsp;Rifle.
        It got two "Wows!" on the "Wow Meter Scale". I had circled the
        Pellet Rifle many months before in the Sears and Roebuck
        Catalog, and asked Grandfather a million questions about it. How
        far would it shoot? Was it very heavy? How big were the pellets?
        How many did the rifle hold? Could you shoot a bear with it? And
        here I was holding my wish in my hands. I could hardly wait to
        shoot it. What a wonderful, wonderful Christmas! And still to
        come, the Christmas Dinner! Oh! I almost forgot; Shep got a new
        fancy collar. Which he was not too overjoyed about.<br>
        <br>
        After all the presents had been opened and Grandmother had
        reclaimed all the ribbons, bows and wrapping paper, we had a
        small breakfast, anticipating the Christmas Feast, yet to come.
        Later that morning we dressed for Church. The Christmas Day
        Service at Grandmother`s Church. I wore one of my new sweaters
        and scarf. After the Church Service ended, we returned to the
        farm around 12:30 pm. Grandmother and my two Aunts, busied
        themselves with the final preparation of all the coming mouth
        watering "Yum, Yum's." Extra leaves were put in the dining room
        and extra chairs were added. The table from the kitchen was
        brought into the dining room. to hold some of the prepared
        dishes. Grandmother's special Christmas table cloth was spread
        over the extended banquet table. Then the table was set with the
        best Chinaware. All the food was transferred in from the
        kitchen. It was about that time to hold hands and gather around.
        After everyone was seated, Uncle Harrison offered the Christmas
        Prayer. His words reminded us of the less fortunate across the
        land that was still suffering from the aftermath of "Black
        Friday" that had paralyzed the Country.<br>
        <br>
        Little did we know at the time, that this Christmas of 1933
        would be the last Christmas that some of us would share
        together? Thank Goodness! we didn't know.<br>
        <br>
        The setting, the gathering, the taste, smell and the abundance
        of all the food was beyond description. It was a regular food
        'Whose Who' starting with the ABC of the food chain and ending
        with the XYZ of it. The ladies out did themselves and we all
        responded by out doing ourselves as we waddled away from the
        table 'penguin style', mumbling; "I ate to much, I ate to much,
        Why, Why?" After the table was cleared and the left-overs were
        wrapped and the kitchen was returned to normal. A short nap was
        in order; my nephew, Shep and I climbed the attic stairs to my
        room and caught a few winks. Maybe an hour had past, I nudged my
        nephew and whispered that I was going to go outside and try out
        my new&nbsp;Pellet rifle. Shep followed us as we went down the
        stairs. As we entered the parlor to get the rifle and some
        pellets, Grandfather came in and said, "I was wondering how long
        it would be before you decided to try out your new&nbsp;Rifle.
        Come on, we will go out behind the barn and set up some targets
        to shoot at. But before there was any shooting to be done,
        Grandfather gave us some words of advice. First: never, never
        point the Rifle at anyone. Secondly, do not shoot near or close
        to the house, always shoot away from the house. Thirdly, do not
        shoot at any of the farm animals or at any of the birds,
        squirrels or rabbits. Because unless the shot is perfect it may
        only cripple and they will escape. When you get a little older
        and learn how to shoot a 22 Rifle, then you can hunt. Now with
        the Pellet Rifle, you can learn how to shoot and gain accuracy.
        Always make sure when you finish shooting that the Rifle is
        unloaded and then clean it. After Grandfather had finished
        speaking he gave us both our first lesson on how to hold,
        breathe and aim the rifle. What a present!<br>
        <br>
        The day after Christmas, my Mother and her boyfriend drove in
        from Indianapolis . After the last Divorce and Custody hearing;
        I only saw my Mother during Christmas and on my birthdays. As I
        have said before her visits were bittersweet. Grandmother and
        Mother were hostel antagonists. There was a deep resentment on
        both sides of the fence (a very high fence). Which made the
        visits, a mixed bag.<br>
        <br>
        Mother was a strikingly beautiful, 24 year old woman. And a true
        portrait of the "Flapper Age" in both style and demeanor. A one,
        two, three strikes and your out as far as my Granmother was
        concerned. She had taken on the appearance and the mannerisms'
        of a Movie Actress by the name of Jean Harlow, a Howard Hughes,
        protegee. Also, there was a little bit of Greta Garbo thrown in.
        She never entered a room, a restaurant or walked down the street
        that heads didn't turn; male and female alike. There was
        something in way she walked, looked and moved. As they do say;
        "she stirred the air and the thoughts." Her liberated ways was a
        'thorn' in my Grandmother's side, setting the stage for an
        on-going battle.<br>
        <br>
        My Mother's presents that particular year&nbsp;were the; "The
        Hardy Boys'" series of books and a set of lead toy soldiers;
        along with some clothes. Her visit ended as usual with a flurry
        of words between her and Grandmother. Finally Grandfather would
        have to step in as he often did, to halt the verbiage.<br>
        <br>
        Since we are remembering about things when I was six years old,
        probably something should be said about my first day at Fillmore
        Elementary School a School which my Father and my two Uncles had
        attended. Some of their Teachers were still teaching. One could
        say; that my first day was different, unusual even humorous
        after the fact. It all happened during what was then called a
        recess period. A a time out when you would go outside and play
        in the school yard. The recess period had come to an end and I
        was being escorted to the Principal's office. By, guess who? The
        Principal himself, But what I did know, this person was trying
        to separate my ear lobe from the rest of my head. My trouble
        started when I refused to give the kickball to another boy after
        the bell rang, ending the play period. After being reprimanded
        by a very large person, I said in a very loud voice;
        "horsefeathers" and this giant said; "what did you say?" I
        repeated; "horse feathers, are you hard of hearing or
        something?" That's when the giant showed a great interest in my
        ear lobe.<br>
        <br>
        Let's back-up several days before this present incident, when I
        had unfortunately allowed two words to escape my lips which were
        overheard by a certain pair of ears which belonged to the long
        arm of the law (only kidding), they belonged to Grandmother. The
        two words in question were "darn it", it seems there was a close
        resemblance to "d-- it". After the 'talk, talk', Uncle Harrison
        asked my why grandmother was upset. I told him about the slip of
        the lip. He told me that the next time I felt the urge to
        mention the unmentionable. Just say "horse feathers" real loud!
        Grandfather showed up at the Principal's office within the hour
        and asked; what the problem was? The Principal related the
        events. Grandfather turned to me and asked; "did you say that?"
        I replied, "Yes sir". My Grandfather said to the principal; "it
        will not happen again, I assure you".<br>
        <br>
        On the way home Grandfather asked; "Where did you learn the word
        "horse-feathers?"? I told him the story about the 'slip of the
        lip' and the little talk with Grandmother. And about Uncle
        Harrison's suggestion, Grandfather chuckled and said; He did,
        did he? Well the "horsefeathers" was not that bad, there are
        some words that would have been worse. The real reason for your
        introduction to the Principal's office was because you said;
        "are you hard of hearing?" That did it! You see the Principal is
        hard of hearing. "Oops!"<br>
        <br>
        A lot could be said about my first year in school but let me
        mention something I believe was pivotal and influential in
        setting the stage for my adjustment to the Learning
        environment,then and later. After my dance "around the Maypole"
        with the over sized 'Ear Puller". The "good old golden School
        Days" took on the unexpected because of my incessant curiosity
        of asking, why? The answers given by the teacher were either to
        simplistic or they were evading the question. The questions were
        asking for more information which was not forth-coming. Inquiry
        and discussion was not encouraged but rather curtailed. I
        thought at the time; I wished the Giants on the farm were there
        to field the questions and give some plausible answers for they
        never tired in answering my why's and wherefores? And if need
        be, explaining the answers given. I learned a very valuable
        lesson long before entering the first grade at the bidding of
        the giants; to question and to keep on questioning until I felt
        I had an understanding or an inkling of what was being said. My
        Grandfather was insistent that I ask questions if I didn't know
        the meaning or understand what&nbsp;was being said. His comment
        was;&nbsp;"You will never learn if you don't ask questions", he
        would say over and over. His other constant reminder; "look it
        up Harry Lee, you were given a pair of eyes and a mind. Find the
        answer and bring it to me and we will talk about it "God helps
        those who help themselves". Sometimes he would add; "A good
        question demands a good answer". "Think about what you are going
        to say before opening your mouth."<br>
        <br>
        In the first year of my Primary education, the 'status quo
        became a matter of accepting the shop-worn prepared answers with
        no maybes, whys or wherefores. My mind instinctively rebelled to
        this simplistic approach; it was against the teachings of the
        Giants. Consequently, School became boring and vapid. I
        retreated into self-inquiry. Earlier on the Giants helped me to
        check-out everything from the Library that was even remotely
        connected to what was being taught. I was a thorny problem. One
        might even say; I was an entire "bramble bush" seated behind a
        desk. A qualified disturbance because I was not being challenged
        therefore I was bored stiffer than stiff. My error was being too
        inquisitive; I needed some answers which were not on the agenda.
        This was not the end of my rebellion. It would take on a
        different direction later on. As this 'Narrative' unfolds, it
        will be evident that these early beginnings were the start of
        something that would affect how I adapted to life issues. There
        are many threads in one's 'Tapestry of Life'. And each thread is
        important for the overall tone, texture and theme of the
        finished design. as is our own personal method of weaving.<br>
        <br>
        There are many things that are doubled edged, remembering is one
        of those things. One minute you are in the throes of joy and the
        very next moment you are in the grasp of despair and sadness.
        Come the early spring of 1934, I lost my Grandfather, a real
        live hero in my young life. I felt the lost, suffered the lost
        and knew the lost. The suddenness of it; realizing I would never
        see him again or hear him call my name left me numb, speechless
        and lost. I would cry myself to sleep. And during the days that
        followed his death: there were those times I thought maybe he
        would be coming out of the Barn or off the back porch any
        minute. But it never happened and finally I had to believe it
        wasn't going to happen. I also knew that part of him would live
        again through me. And that thought, I have carried with me all
        the years of my life.<br>
        <br>
        No one in the family was prepared for his death. He was a man
        full of life; his eyes, voice, his manner,the way he walked,
        everything about him spoke of this aliveness, this energy, both
        were infectious. What is that saying; "he was truly a man for
        all seasons". If Grandfather ever had any pain or an ache, no
        one ever knew about it. He could out work any two men on any
        given day up until he died. There was no warning, he just went
        to sleep and never woke up. Everybody, family, community, all
        who knew him was in a state of shock. As was the custom of the
        day, before the burial, a sort of Wake was held. After the
        embalming, Grandfathers' casket was brought to the farm house.
        Friends, relatives and neighbours came by to offer the usual
        condolences. Two days later the funeral was held and the
        internment followed. Grandmother was devastated, she aged
        overnight. Grandfather was not only her husband; he was her
        pillar of strength. In the ensuing days Grandmother grew weaker
        and frailer. The lost and sorrow was taking its' toll. The light
        in her eyes was fading; her hands were beginning to tremble. The
        grief was killing her softly.<br>
        <br>
        Other unknown events were simultaneously happening in
        Indianapolis . My Mother had become engaged and married to a man
        of substantial means and influence in Indianapolis . Mother was
        not aware that Grandfather had passed away. Just after her
        marriage, she and her new Lawyer filed for a new Custody
        Hearing. This Lawyer was reputed to be one of the&nbsp;best
        legal minds in Indianapolis . Surprisingly what a little money
        can do? Did I say a little, I meant a lot of money. The case was
        to be held in Indianapolis . Almost a month following
        Grandfather's death,.Uncle Harrison intercepted a subpoena
        without Grandmother's knowledge that gave the date of the
        hearing. He managed to find out the new Lawyer's name and
        address. From there he acquired Mothers' new address. He made a
        quick trip to Indianapolis to visit and speak to my Mother about
        the untimely death of my Grandfather and the physical condition
        of Grandmother's health. He ask her to visit me and to make no
        mention of his visit. He want her to see Grandmother's decline.
        For he believed that if the Custody case was held as
        scheduled.That a second loss so soon after losing her husband
        would cause her immediate death. Mother arrived at the farm two
        days after Uncle Harrison's visit. I was out in the Barn playing
        with Shep when he started barking as he bolted out the door, as
        I brought up the rear. There was a brand new shiny black car
        pulling into the driveway. Uncle Harrison and Uncle Ray were
        walking towards the car. The door on the driver's side opened an
        a man got out, he walked around to the other side and opened the
        door on the passenger's side. It was then I saw mother step from
        the car, I ran full tilt to get a big hug and a kiss. When I
        reached her we both had tears in our eyes. Introductions were
        made, along with Uncle Harrison telling my Mother about
        Grandfather's death, as though it was the first time she had
        heard about it. No one knew about about the secret meeting. All
        of us went into the farmhouse to visit with Grandmother, E.W
        staid in the parlor. Very few words were spoken in the
        bedroom&nbsp;it was questionable wither Grandmother even
        recognized Mother. It was evident that Grandmother was fading
        and in no way resembled her usual self. After we had left the
        room Mother said to Uncle Harrison," I am so sorry, it is hard
        to believe how much she has aged. I will do as you said and wait
        for your call."<br>
        <br>
        Mother and I walked back to the car and climbed into the
        backseat and talked. She never mentioned the real reason for her
        surprised trip to the farm. I learned much later the whys and
        wherefores. She spoke about her marriage to E.W. and the new
        home they bought. She mentioned that maybe in the summer I could
        come and visit. I was not aware of the new Custody Case. After
        about an hour she said that that they had to be leaving. We got
        out of the backseat. E.W. and my two Uncles were approaching the
        car. They were asking about the Automobile and E.W. proudly
        explained that it was a new design that Chrysler had just put on
        the market. It sure was a big one, the biggest one that I had
        ever seen. "Goodbyes" were said along with another big hug and a
        kiss and they drove away.<br>
        <br>
        Not even a month had past since my Mother's surprise visit. When
        Uncle Harrison called her and told her that Grandmother had
        passed away. And that the Funeral would be in two days. He asked
        if she would please attend if possible and she said she would
        come. The day of the Funeral she arrived, she drove down by
        herself. She knew instinctively the grief I was floundering in.
        I couldn't understand how Grandfather and Grandmother were no
        longer with me, that I would never, see them again. It wasn't
        fair, I was so empty. There were even thoughts about my
        disappearing forever or my Mother, Father or Uncles. I had seen
        death on the farm, as animals died but this was different, the
        sadness and the hurt was not the same. And I was not the same. I
        lost sleep, I lost weigh, I was blah! I was not a Happy Camper!<br>
        <br>
        Grandmother was laid side by side next to Grandfather. I didn't
        realize the full impact of both their deaths until much later.
        There were times when I believed that they were just on a long
        trip and would return home, any time now. It is indeed strange
        that in our grief we come to realize how much we loved the
        departed and somehow feel guilty. Wondering why? We did not
        express our love, our appreciation more often while they were
        with us. And even now in this remembering; the hurt and sadness
        has resurfaced. Both of my Grandparents gave so much of
        themselves to me. Much of who and what I am, was influenced by
        both. Their ceaseless love and concern far out weighed the
        strife. Because all who were involved were much more than the
        perceived negativity, that would come and go. They held one
        thing in common, their affectionate caring for me.<br>
        <br>
        The Custody Hearing was held in Indianapolis in the early
        summer. The decision of the Court gave Mother full Custody and
        visiting rights to my Father and Uncles. Also there was a
        provision providing that on the agreement of both concerned
        parties; summer vacation visits to the farm could be arranged.<br>
        <br>
        On recalling my departure from the Farm it made me 'sicken unto
        death'. A part of me was everywhere, inside and outside the
        Homestead . I am sure that that part of me is still hanging
        around. If this is not true, I am certain, I know that all I
        experienced, felt, saw and heard in those early formative years
        is still with me. But little did I know that my life was going
        to be turned upside down. A new page was to be written. 'The
        Farmboy becomes a City boy.'<br>
        <br>
        Allow me to rearrange my remembering and put several memories
        ahead of those which were time wise first; to illustrate my
        transformation. Move over "Pygmalion!" There is a saying; "that
        you can take the boy out of the country. But you can't take the
        country out of the boy." I am quite sure Mother was aware of
        that quote. She just did not agree with the conclusion. Little
        did I know that in 'La,la Land', a place called Hollywood ,
        there was another young boy named Freddie Bartholomew who had
        been born in Dublin , Ireland 1926 and abandoned, raise by an
        Aunt Cissy. Who became a very successful Child Actor. In some
        convoluted way, Mother imagined a resemblance between the Child
        Actor and myself which became the genesis of my make-over. There
        were Movie posters and photos of young Freddie, enough to stir
        the imagination of my Mother. Out of which she fashioned an
        "Image" as to how I was to be dressed.<br>
        <br>
        One morning shortly after my arrival in the big City, we drove
        into town. The clothes I was wearing at the time were clothes
        which she had given me at Christmas Time, when she had made her
        annual visit to the Farm. Our first shopping store was L. S.
        Ayres Department Store. I put on and took off more clothes than
        a 'Cat-walk model'. Every time I looked into the mirror I
        wondered who that was staring back at me. If Shep had been
        watching this 'Clothes Changing Marathon', he would have been
        the first dog who died laughing. Speaking of Shep, I was really
        missing him. One of the hardest things about my leaving the farm
        was leaving behind my good old reliable Shep, who made so many
        of my days on the farm, happy days. They do say; 'That a dog is
        mans' best friend'. Well Shep was that and more to me. Well back
        to "Clothes Caper". During our eternity march through the isles
        of cloth, buttons and zippers searching for the right outfit to
        be worn by the alter-ego conjured up in my Mother's mind. I
        stepped out between the curtains of the dressing room and my
        Mother said as if she had just seen a vision. "Yes! Yes! that's
        the one" , that's the one. He will wear it, wrap up his old
        clothes." As I looked in the mirror, I thought to myself; "no!
        no!, not me, I can't walk out of the store looking like
        this."Please!, bare with me while I try to remember the items I
        was wearing. Let's start with the shoes; they were shiny black
        patents with little bows. Then came the white knee length silk
        stockings just below the pleated velvet short pants and the
        tucked in white silk shirt that had ruffled cuffs that slightly
        extended beyond the velvet cuff. At the waist of the velvet
        pants was a red silk sash tied in the middle hanging at my side.
        We are not through yet, last came the 'piece de resistance' a
        wide brim hat with 'a gold hat band and a feather plume sticking
        out of the band. All I needed was a fencing foil. Mr. Dumas
        would have been proud. I am not to sure about the remaining
        Musketeers. Well sure as the Sun rises in the East, my Mother
        and I exited the store. I was wearing a ridiculous outfit
        (that's a gross understatement)and my Mother was wearing a proud
        smile. As we walked into one of the finest Restaurants in
        Indianapolis . I could feel the eyes following us to a table as
        we were seated. I was hoping that the staring was because my
        Mother as usual looked as if she had just stepped out of the
        Vogue Fashion Magazine. As always, she was a show stopper. I
        suffered through the meal and my self-consciousness. I thought
        it would never end. Finally the check was called for and we
        walked through the gauntlet of curious eyes once again before
        reaching the front door. As the Maitre d' opened the door and
        handed me my hat, he said; "Nice feather!" On the way home I
        asked if I could change clothes in the car before we got home?
        My Mother said, "No", I want your Father to see your new outfit.
        We arrived home; Mother got out and asked if I would bring the
        rest of the packages into the house.<br>
        <br>
        She went on into the house.I grabbed the rest of the packages.
        And was backing out of the car with the packages. As I turned
        around, there were two boys and a girl standing in front of me.
        The bigger of the boys said; "you must be the new kid from the
        farm". I acknowledged and answered "yes". Then he said "your
        dressed a little early for Holloween aren't you". I grinned as
        they laughed. He continued; "you look like a Momma's sissy-boy
        to me, I don't like Momma sissy-boys." I didn't know what he was
        talking about; I started toward the house with the packages. He
        knocked them out of my hands and pushed me against the car. "You
        aren't listening to me sissy-boy." I tried to pick-up the boxes
        but he knocked them out of my hands again. "I'm going to teach
        you a lesson. He took a swing at me and it landed in the middle
        of my face, blood was coming out of my nose. I pushed him away
        and he tripped over the fallen boxes. I started to run towards
        the house but his side-kick tripped me and the ground came up
        and met me. They both were seated on top of me taking turns in a
        punching marathon. I remembered very little after that, but my
        Mother told me that the Postman yelled at them and they
        disappeared. E.W arrived shortly after the melee and asked
        jokingly, "if I got the license plate of the truck that ran over
        me." I managed a smile.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of all the excitement, Mother wanted to call the
        Police. But E.W. intervened and said it would be a waste of
        time. No one knew who the trio was. It would be my word against
        theirs. The black eye, the cut lip and the bleeding nose was
        evident that a fight had&nbsp;taken place, that's all. Positive
        identification would have been "iffy". E.W. said he would call
        Swifty, there was another alternative. That call changed my life
        and the consequences multiplied down through the years. Most of
        which were positive.<br>
        <br>
        (Please allow a side note)<br>
        <br>
        Shortly after my arrival in the big City, E.W., had invited a
        few business associates and their families over for a barbecue
        one evening. A man by the name of Swifty and his son Jimmy were
        on the Guest list. Jimmy and I were the only young people among
        the adults. During the evening Jimmy and I became acquainted. He
        asked about my life on the farm and I asked about his life in
        the Big City . I learned that he was three years my senior and
        that he was the only child, his Mother had died during his
        birth. It was just he and his Father. And that his Father and
        E.W. were business associates as well as friends, they had know
        each other for a long time. I also learned that I would be going
        to the same School as he went too, come fall.<br>
        <br>
        The rest of the story, where were we?<br>
        <br>
        The next day Swifty and Jimmy came to the house. His first
        remark after seeing my face; "I see you forgot to duck." During
        the conversation that followed I learned that Swifty Peterson
        had been a professional boxer and at one time had been a sparing
        partner for Jim Braddock the former Heavyweight Champion. In
        1929, Braddock was preparing to fight against Tommy Longhran, a
        Light- heavyweight. It was during his preparation for the match,
        that Swifty became one of Braddock's sparing partners. Braddock
        was defeated in that fight. The Depression hit and boxing bouts
        were few and far in between. But in 1935 Braddock won some
        notable fights over a couple of highly ranked Heavyweights and
        was then matched against Max Baer, the then Heavy-weight
        Champion of the World. The fight was held on Long Island , New
        York (1935). Braddock was a 10 to 1 underdog and the unthinkable
        happened, he beat the World Champion that night and came to be
        known as the 'Cinderella Man'. He held the title for two years,
        then in 1937 the "Brown Bomber-Joe Louis defeated Braddock.
        After that he had one more fight defeating Tommy Farr after
        which he retired. (Sorry, for the detour) Swifty now owned a Gym
        where aspiring young boxers trained. He also mentioned that
        Jimmy his son&nbsp;had won the 'Junior Golden Glove Tournament'
        the previous year. And then he turned to me and asked; "would
        you like to learn how to defend yourself son?" Of course my
        answer was "Yes." Mother started to say something but E.W. put
        his finger to his lips. She never finished the sentence.<br>
        <br>
        A week later; Jimmy was teaching and training with me. This was
        done early in the mornings before the Gym was officially open.
        Swifty, Jimmy and I opened the doors of the Gym at seven each
        morning. I learned how to skip rope, work the heavy bag and the
        speed bag on a raised platform for me to stand on.Jimmy worked
        along side of me, teaching me all that his dad had taught him as
        far as the basics. I didn't put on the boxing gloves, the head
        gear or the Kidney belt till after six weeks had past. I was
        taught stance, footwork, how to punch and the shifting of the
        weight for each type of punch. We did defensive and offensive
        drills, shadow and mirror boxing. Not to mention all the
        running, sit-ups and push-ups. After six weeks of six days a
        week; E.W., myself, Jimmy and Swifty arrived at the Gym one
        morning for my first sparring session inside the Ring with
        Jimmy, with all the gear. E.W. had brought me a present that
        morning, a pair of 12 oz . Boxing gloves that had Jack Demsey's
        name printed on them. Jimmy was about three inches taller than
        me, 15 lbs. heavier and faster. After we had our gear on Jimmy,
        I and Swifty stepped between the ropes. Swifty called out all
        the routines, defensive and offensive, all the different punches
        to be thrown. He corrected my footwork and the shifting of the
        weight as I threw my punches.There were three, three minute
        rounds. I could hardly raise my arms after the first round which
        meant I got tagged by Jimmy more than I should have and also
        yelled at by Swifty. I tried to remember all the things I had
        been taught in the last six weeks while I was becoming a
        punching bag. In the entire first session I don't believe I
        landed a head shot. After my first sparing lesson was over;
        Swifty said; "you did fine son", if he hadn't been looking at me
        when he said it. I would have thought he was speaking to Jimmy.
        He went on to say to me; you will spar three rounds each
        training session from now on. And your running will increase to
        one mile each day and you will shadow box with the boxing gloves
        on. Jimmy will train with you all the way. By the second week in
        August, I knew what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong
        in the Ring. The three rounds were getting easier; I was
        countering more punches, my footwork and shifting was coming
        together with my punches. I was beginning to understand how all
        the training was fitting together. Why all the constant
        repetitiveness.. Jimmy and I were becoming like brothers even
        though he was out pounding me everyday. One day I asked him if
        he was pulling his punches, he said; he was at one time but no
        more. I was getting the best he had. Thank God! for the head
        gear and the Kidney belt.<br>
        <br>
        During the first six weeks, every bone, muscle and fibre of my
        body ached. When I started sparring all the aches were gone. I
        acquired new ones from all the pounding on my arms and the
        punches to the body and head. Mother was worried that it was to
        much but Swifty reassured her that my body and mind were
        adapting. To prove his point Swifty had arranged a three round
        bout with another boy who was eight years old and who had been
        boxing for a little over a year. He had had three fights and won
        them all. Swifty believed I could stay with him in the ring. In
        weight and height we were equal. There was a full week to train
        before the Fight. Jimmy had seen the other boy fight and he was
        confident I could take him. The one thing that Jimmy had
        noticed, my opponent had a difficult time when he was in the
        corners of the ring or on the ropes and trapped. So all my
        training that week was to stay out of the center of the ring and
        force my opponent into the corner or on the ropes and work on a
        solid body attack to bring his arms down for a head shot.<br>
        <br>
        The night of the fight arrived, I needed a butterfly net, my
        stomach was churning, Swifty and Jimmy&nbsp;were taping my hands
        and massaging my arms and shoulders talking away with their
        separate 'pep' talks. I was there but not there. I was trying to
        remember everything I was taught, it was coming and going. Then
        someone said; "It's time, let's go." We walked out of the
        dressing room into the Gym. It was then I saw Mother, E.W. and a
        couple of other people seated with my parents.. The rest of the
        Ringside was filled with many of the other boxers and trainers
        that used the Gym. That didn't help my butterflys, I ducked
        under the ropes, Jimmy joined me. Swifty joined my parents. It
        was decided that Jimmy would be in my corner giving instructions
        as the Fight progressed. Also a friend of Swiftys was to be my
        cut man if I suffered any bleeding. I thought to myself that it
        was nice to know that I wouldn't bleed to death. I looked over
        to the opposite corner at my opponent, he seemed calmer than I
        was. Introductions were made in the center of the Ring. My
        opponent looked a little heavier than me. Back to my corner, the
        bell rang and Jimmy said; "go get'em Irish". His first jab
        snapped my head back; I felt the sting of the leather, as
        another jab reached my face. I heard Jimmy yelling, "get out of
        the center." I moved forward ducking under the next jab,
        shifting my weight as I hooked my left into his mid-section just
        below his rib-cage. He back up towards the ropes. I followed
        shifting my weight again, this time my right caught him on the
        right side of his rib-cage. He was hurting, I had him trapped
        against the ropes, and I pounded his mid-section with all my
        strength, his hands dropped just like Jimmy had predicted. At
        that point I saw the image of the Bully that had beaten me,
        standing in front of me. I shifted my stance and brought my
        right hand up catching him as he was sinking to the canvas. The
        fight was over. Jimmy jumped into the Ring and raised my hand in
        Victory. Again I was there but I wasn't, I heard very little of
        the cheering. I went to the ropes and saw my cheering section
        clapping their hands and waving. Then I went over to the
        opposite corner and shook my opponent's hand. By that time
        Swifty had climbed into the ring. He threw his arms around me
        and said; I knew it, I knew you could take him." "How's it feel
        son? I said; "great!" but I really couldn't say; "how I felt or
        what I was feeling at that moment." When we returned to the
        dressing room, there were people outside the door waiting to
        congratulate and shake my hand. Inside waiting was mother and
        E.W.; E.W. said; "You did good, real good." Mother hugged me and
        I blushed. The last to congratulate me, was my best friend,
        trainer and adopted brother. I thanked both him and his Father.<br>
        <br>
        After I had showered and dressed, we all piled into the Chrysler
        to go put on the fed bag. That was my first and last Ring fight
        during my early formative years.I now knew how to defend myself
        but much more than that. Swifty and son not only taught me how
        to box, they taught me about discipline and persistence. But I
        learned something even greater, the 'will to win' and a lesson
        about friendship. Jimmy and his Father both gave of themselves
        to me (There is no greater gift than the giving of oneself to
        another) that was their legacy to me.<br>
        <br>
        Since I skipped over a few memories that should have come first,
        we will now rectify that and talk about pulling up in front of
        my Mother's new home. My first words were those old standbys;
        Golly gee! And Wow! Make that a double "Wow!" It was a large
        brown brick structure, two storied house, sitting back off the
        street with a large front lawn with landscaping, including
        hedges and flowers around a large front porch. E.W. opened the
        front door and I stepped inside, I didn't know what to say, my
        favorite words escaped me. I just stood there and stared. I was
        in the parlor, later I was corrected, and it was called the
        living room. There were pieces of furniture of which I had never
        seen nor had I ever seen a room that big. It went on
        forever&nbsp;Then we walked into what was called a Foyer where
        there was a writing desk with a fancy telephone sitting on it.
        There were two doors, one led to the dining-room and the other
        to the Kitchen. Also there&nbsp; was a stairway that led to the
        upstairs. The dining room had a large table with a lot of chairs
        around it. On one wall was a large painting that took up half
        the wall, a Landscape scene with a Castle peeking out from
        behind some trees against a background of mountains. Over and
        against another wall was a large glassed China Cabinet filled
        with beautiful China and Crystal Glassware. And oh, yes!, in the
        middle of the dining room table a large Silver Tea Serving Set.
        Next we went through a swinging door into the Kitchen and there
        was a lady cooking up something and whatever it was, it smelled
        delicious. I was introduced to Hilda, she was the cook and the
        housekeeper, and she lived on the premises. The kitchen itself
        was a lot bigger than the kitchen on the farm. But some of the
        things in the kitchen were things I had never seen. Such as a
        refrigerator that kept food cold. Two stoves that were called
        gas stoves and a large stainless steel sink with counters and
        running water. Then Hilda opened a door to what was called a
        Pantry, I thought I was standing in a Grocery Store, it was
        shelved from top to bottom with all sorts of canned foods,
        etc... We left the kitchen by another door and we were standing
        in the Foyer again. Mother then said; would you like to see your
        room? After we reached the top of the stairs, she opened the
        door of my room. It was something else, the room was huge.There
        was a double size bed with two tables one on each side of the
        bed with lamps on each. Book shelves with books on the wall over
        the headboard of the bed. Across from the bed there was a desk
        with a lamp on it. And guess what was lying on the desk, a copy
        of National Geographic. On another wall that had a door were
        some more shelves also with books on them. Across from the wall
        that had a door there was a large two paneled sliding door that
        was called a closet, it was like another room. There were
        sliding drawers built into the walls of the closet for clothes.
        Mother said; it's empty now but we will do some shopping. E.W.
        remarked; "When your Mother uses the word "shopping", it's more
        like a Marathon ."<br>
        <br>
        Finally I asked where does that door lead?<br>
        <br>
        E.W. said; why don't you open it and see for yourself. When I
        opened it, it was a screened in balcony that looked down on the
        landscaped backyard. It also had a steel ladder below a trap
        door that went to the ground. I thought to myself an escape
        hatch for when the Pirates come. Shep would have like that, even
        though he couldn't use it. There were just no words to describe
        how great everything was. We stepped out into the hallway and
        Mother showed me my bathroom. Again, I had never seen anything
        like it, except for some pictures in Magazines. It had a big
        bathtub with a shower and running water /hot/cold and a one
        seater that flushed. No more going out side and a sink with a
        mirror. Then she showed me the Master bedroom that faced the
        front of the house. It was fancy, fancy, it looked like a
        bedroom you would see in the Movies. It had a fireplace with a
        sitting area.Then a small alcove that led into a very large
        Bathroom with a sunken tub and a separate sink with a separate
        Shower and another one seater.The last 'show and tell' was a
        spacious Guest room further down the hall with its own bathroom,
        End of the Tour. Hilda appeared from out of nowhere and told
        Mother that Lunch was ready.<br>
        <br>
        Mother asked if I wanted to wash my hands before eating. When I
        had finished, I joined Mother and E.W. in the Living Room. Then
        we went into the Dining Room. The table was all set. E.W. took a
        seat at one end of the table and Mother took her place at the
        other end. I was seated in the middle facing the both of them.
        As I sat there I began to notice there were things on the table
        of which I had never seen before. In front of me; there were two
        forks of different sizes to the left of my plate and on the
        other side of my plate there were two different kinds of knives,
        two different types of spoons to the right of the knives. Also
        there was a rolled up white piece of cloth with a silver band
        around it to the right of the silverware.Then I heard a bell
        being rung. I looked up; it was Mother who was holding a small
        bell in her hand. Hilda appeared with a tray of bowls (Mushroom
        soup), serving my Mother first, then E.W. and then me. I was
        watching Mother she took the cloth with the silver band, removed
        the band and placed the cloth in her lap. Then she took the
        funny looking spoon and dipped it into the bowl. I followed suit
        and did exactly as she did. She then asks Hilda who was standing
        behind E.W. if she would please pass the butter. Hilda brought
        the butter to her, Mother thanked her and then she took the
        small knife by her plate and buttered a bread roll. She told
        Hilda to bring the butter to me. Hilda handed me the butter.
        Mother looked at me and I said "thank you". Then I buttered my
        bread roll with the small knife and ate my soup. I noticed that
        when Mother was dipping her soup spoon into the bowl, she did
        not move it towards her; she moved it away from her and then
        lifted it to her mouth. So I copied her motion, I caught her
        smiling at me. All through the meal I waited, watched and did
        what Mother did. During the meal there were some questions and
        some small conversation. When I had finished eating, I pushed my
        chair back a little and started to get up. I was half way up,
        when Mother cleared her throat, I looked at her and her eyes and
        head motioned for me to sit myself back down, which I did. She
        asked if I was finished. I said "yes maam"&nbsp;that I was
        finished. Would you like to go up to your room for a while or
        would you like to stay and have some ice cream and then go up to
        your room. Her idea sounded a lot better than mine. After I had,
        had my ice cream, she said you may go up to your room now. I
        will be up to see you in&nbsp;a little later. I excused myself;
        I had learned that from my Grandmother.<br>
        <br>
        After I was in my room, I began looking at the books that Mother
        had placed on all the bookshelves. There were books by Mark
        Twain, "Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer",Edgar Rice Burroughs,
        "The Tarzan Series", Victor Hugo's, "The Man Who Laughs" and
        "the Hunchback of Notre Dame', Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock
        Holmes Collection", Jules Verne's, "Around The World In Eighty
        Days" and "Twenty Leagues Beneath The Sea," Alexander Dumas's,
        "The Three Musketeers." and " The Man In The Iron Mask". Some
        books of Poetry by Wordsworth, Longfellow, Keats and Shelly,
        Elizabeth Barrett Browning. A book 'Of the Religions of the
        World' and a complete set of 'Children'&nbsp;s Encyclopaedias.
        And twenty 'Big Little Books.' Also ten Comic Books and let's
        not forget that National Geographic. Just amazing, just simply
        amazing!<br>
        <br>
        Later that afternoon Mother came to my room and we talked. She
        asked how I was and if there was anything I wished to ask or
        talk about? I told her that I wanted to thank her and E.W. for
        all the things they had done for me. But that I was having a
        difficult time absorbing all the past events and all the new
        ones that were happening so fast around me. It was not that I
        was not happy being with her, which I was but the sudden lost of
        my Grandparents. Plus the leaving of the farm was very much with
        me. Not to ever see, speak or hear Grandfather and Grandmother
        again was very hard for me to understand why? Possibly when I
        was&nbsp;older I will better understand. Mother quickly added
        that she was aware of my hurt and my feelings. And that she was
        there and would always be there for me. Then she said: I am
        going to tell you something; when I was about your age my Mother
        passed away and my Father told me a story about a great King.
        Would you like to hear the story? "Yes!"<br>
        <br>
        Long, long ago there was a King in search of the right words
        that could be engraved on a Golden ring he wore. Words that
        would guide him, in the best of times and in the worse of times.
        Words that would give a peace of mind and a steady heart come
        what may! A King's ransom of Gold would be given to anyone who
        could think of the right words to be engraved on the Golden
        ring. One day a messenger delivered a single page scroll tied
        with a Golden ribbon to be given to the King. When the King
        received the scroll, he opened it and there were four words
        imprinted in Gold.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#990000">"This too shall pass ."</font></strong><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        At the bottom of the page, the Giver of the five words had
        written. Give the reward of Gold to the poor. There are no
        monies for either Wisdom or Truth for they are both gifts that
        Gold cannot buy. Wear these words in good faith. May your life
        be blessed? What ever may come your way 'good or bad' remember,<br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#990000">"This too shall pass."</font></strong><br>
        <br>
        Peace unto you!<br>
        <br>
        Did you like the Story? "I sure did" Can you say: "This too
        shall pass" "Yes""This too shall pass ." Grandfather used to
        say; "what ever happened yesterday leave it to yesterday, "Live
        today for today." Your Grandfather was&nbsp;a very wise man.<br>
        <br>
        The things you are feeling now, the difficulty you are
        experiencing, they will go away. Every beginning has an ending
        and every ending a beginning.&nbsp;I promise you that in the
        days to come. These hurts you are feeling now will lessen with
        every passing day. And you will be left with loving memories of
        both your Grandfather and your Grandmother who loved you very
        much. And they will always be a part of your life. Please
        believe me, this will be so.<br>
        <br>
        Then she said, would you like for me to read something from your
        new collection of books? Yes, I would like that; I'll go and
        pick one out. I went and took, "The Man in the Iron Mask" from
        the shelve. We fluffed up a couple of pillows on the bed and she
        began to read. It was like old times. I fell asleep while she
        was reading to me. When I awoke, it was getting dark outside.
        Mother had left me a note saying that when I had awakened, to
        come and knock on her door and we would have something to eat.
        She called Hilda on the intercom and asked her to fix some
        Chicken noodle soup and two grilled cheese sandwiches and two
        large chocolate milk shakes. Please bring them up to the room.
        After the snacks, we listened to the "Eddie Cantor Show" on the
        Radio which I had never heard. Mother explained that Mr. Cantor
        was a&nbsp;very famous entertainer, his nick name was 'Banjo
        eyes', because he could roll his eyes in many directions as he
        was singing and dancing. Also he was a very funny man and made
        everybody laugh. There was also a singer on the program called
        Kenny Baker; he was one of Mother's favourites. After the Radio
        Program was finished,I got ready for bed. It was going to be my
        first night in my new room. Sleep came quickly it had been a
        good day! Mother came in to kiss me "good night", all was well.<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, I was awakened by a family of birds. It
        sounded as if they had built their nest some where near the
        balcony. I stumbled out of bed, grabbed my robe and opened the
        door to the balcony to see if I could see them. Their notes
        sounded like the red robins back on the farm. I took a seat in a
        wicker chair and waited for their song again. Sure enough their
        nest was just above the drain pipe coming from the roof.I had a
        new family. I went back inside and checked the clock on the
        night stand. It was 6 Am., I opened the door to my
        bedroom&nbsp;quietly and I heard a sound coming from the
        kitchen. I tippy-toed down the back stairs that led to the
        kitchen and peeked around the corner, it was Hilda busying
        herself in the kitchen. She had heard me, and said; "Good
        morning, Master Lee, breakfast well be at seven, would you like
        to have something to drink now, "No, I'll wait for breakfast.
        I'll go back upstairs and get ready. A little later there was a
        knock on my door, it was Mother. She came in and noticed that I
        was completely dressed, hair combed and all. She said my, my,
        aren't you the early bird" You know the early bird always gets
        the worm". Let's go down for breakfast.&nbsp;(I said to myself;
        I hope Hilda doesn't serve any worms).&nbsp;&nbsp; E.W. will be
        eating later, he worked late last night. We entered the dining
        room and sat down. Hilda popped up from&nbsp;around the corner
        and Mother said;"you can tell Hilda what you want for breakfast
        besides your orange juice. Can I have some Wheaties and some
        pancakes with honey and a glass of milk?" Mother went on to say;
        I'll have, two, two minute eggs and two slices of toast with
        butter and some tea, thank you Hilda. Our breakfast arrived
        chop, chop. After breakfast, I went upstairs to brush my teeth.
        Mother said she was going to get dressed and that later in the
        morning, we would take the car into town and buy a few things at
        the City Market for the weekend.<br>
        <br>
        You can check out the backyard and the Garage while I am getting
        dressed. I'll have Hilda call you when I am about ready to
        leave. I had only seen the backyard from my balcony. So I went
        through the kitchen and out the back door to the backyard. I was
        curious about a fairly large structure back away from the house.
        There was an inlayed stone path leading out to a rectangle
        building that was covered with a see through material. But just
        before reaching the building there was pretty big water fountain
        with a statue of young maiden (someone had stoen her
        clothes)&nbsp;pouring water from a large jar. Inside the
        structure were about six tables and chairs around each table,
        plus a long countertop with a sink. Outside, surrounding the
        building were large candle holders with oversized candles. I
        still had no idea of what I was looking at. Then I spotted what
        looked like a large fireplace. And in front of this fireplace
        were a number of tables and benches. Also there was a wood box
        full of wood. Surrounding this large backyard was a high wall
        and in front of the wall were high hedges, You couldn't see what
        was on the other side. Further back on the property was an open
        are a with some tables and chairs. Later, I found out that
        Badminton was played there and sometimes Croquet. Just then I
        heard Hilda calling me! When I reached her she said; "your
        mother wants you to change into the clothes she laid out on your
        bed. She is about ready to go. You better double-time getting
        dressed". I was standing in the living room when Mother came
        down the stairs. Hilda had already opened the Garage doors. We
        went into the Garage then bye, bye to downtown.<br>
        <br>
        Mother was good driver, but in the early years of cars there
        were not that many women drivers, Cars were a mans' domain. It
        was a rarity to see a Platinum blonde wheeling a large Chrysler
        Car through the&nbsp;downtown traffic in the early nineteen
        hundreds. During the drive to Town, Mother asked about my
        exploration of the 'back forty' and wondered if I had a chance
        to take a peek into the Garage. I told her that I had only time
        to walk around the backyard, before Hilda called me. Then I
        asked about the small structure and the fireplace? Then about
        the two poles and the strange looking fish net. She said that
        the small building by the Water Fountain was called a 'Cabana'
        and that the fireplace was called a Barbecue pit where you could
        cook steaks, chicken and hamburgers outside. And that the Cabana
        was like an out door dining room. And the other area you asked
        about is for playing badmitton and croquet. E.W. can show you
        all that. "Well, we are here!" All we have to do now is to find
        a parking place close by. As luck would have it, somebody was
        pulling out of a parking place. And Mother wheeled in front of
        another car that was heading for the same place. The man in the
        other car yelled at Mother and she honked the horn at him. He
        parked his car in the middle of the street and headed towards
        our car. Mother had already parked the car and was opening her
        door and standing outside. Before the man could open his mouth,
        Mother said "Now if you are going to yell at me again, I am
        going to ask all these people who heard you yell at me." "Who
        got here first"? Four men said; you did ma'am. Then a women who
        just joined the little crowd, spoke up "you ought to be ashamed
        of yourself yelling at this fine lady. You are no gentleman, no
        siree!" "Yeah, someone else yelled, "why don't you apologize to
        the young lady?" "Sorry ma'am", the gathered crowd clapped and
        as we walked away, Mother waved, wave son, to those nice people.
        She was indeed 'a piece of cake'.<br>
        <br>
        After the short delay we walked into the City Market. When ever
        we stopped and purchased something, Mother attracted the
        attention. I learned a little after several outings with my
        Mother that&nbsp;she played to her audience. She looked like
        a&nbsp;"somebody" to those who stopped to look. And if she was
        not somebody who was famous, she should have been. Most thought
        she was an actress, or someone they had seen in the newspaper.
        Her manner, her clothes everything about her seem to say, look
        at me! After we had finished shopping, Mother said that we were
        going to meet E.W. at a Restaurant not to far from the Market.
        Everything Mother had bought was going to be delivered to the
        house. How nice!<br>
        <br>
        When we arrived at the Restaurant E.W. was already seated at a
        table, the Maitre D' showed us to the table. Well Lee, how was
        your shopping tour with your Mother. Eventful I bet! I told him
        about the parking incident and he just laughed. Then he said you
        better get use to it. Your Mother is full of surprises, never a
        dull moment. That's why she is my Gal! We better order before
        they start charging us rent for this table. Mother ordered for
        me and her. E.W had ordered before we arrived, his food was
        waiting. Mother ordered my favorite, a big juicy hamburger,
        potato salad and a big milk shake. Mother told E.W. the
        questions I had asked about the recreation area in the back
        yard. And he said when we get home, we will go out into the
        backyard and I will explain it.<br>
        <br>
        He said to Mother, after we are finished eating. Why don't you
        leave your keys with the Maitre D, I will call somebody and they
        will pick-up the car and take it to the house. We will go back
        home in my car. I have somewhere to stop on the way, it will be
        but a minute.I have a surprise for Lee. I asked Mother if she
        knew what the surprise was. She shook her head, no, whatever it
        is will be a surprise to me also. E.W. paid the check, Mother
        gave the keys to the Maitre D'. There was Car, what a Car
        waiting at the curb, the Valet opened the door for my mother,
        then opened the back door for me. E.W. was already behind the
        steering wheel. I said to Mother whose Car is this and Mother
        said this is E.W.'s pride and joy, his baby! He won't even let
        me drive it. I had never seen a car like it.The Car we drove
        downtown was nice, but this Car was something else! Mother went
        on to say; this is called a Pierce Arrow(Phaeton.) There are not
        too many of these on the road. Maybe someday, E.W. will tell you
        about how he happens to be driving a Pierce Arrow? E.W. said;
        yes, someday. How is the ride back there Lee? Great, just great!
        We got home and E.W. parked the Car out in front of the house.<br>
        <br>
        Fooled you, you thought I forgot about the surprise.<br>
        <br>
        Emily, bring in the surprise. She rounded the corner, I almost
        jumped out of my skin and yelled; it's a dog, look Mother it is
        a dog! Mother was as surprised as I was. E.W. said how do you
        like your surprise? I ran over and gave him a real big hug,
        "thank you! Thank you! Can I pick him up? When I picked him up
        and held him, he wiggled and squirmed and tried to lick my face.
        After Mother recovered from the surprise, she asked; what kind
        of dog is he. Mr. Wells said, it is called a Boxer. If you have
        noticed his paws, they are large for a young puppy. He will grow
        to be about two feet plus high and about three feet an
        a&nbsp;half&nbsp;long. His weight will be some where around
        Sixty pounds. This breed is great around children and very
        protective.They are a gentle dog but they also are an excellent
        watch dog. And very trainable, in fact I would highly recommend
        for the dog and Master Lee to go to a ' Dog Obedience School .'
        It will be a good experience for both the dog and your son. Lee
        will learn how to give the commands both verbally and by hand
        signals. You will have a well trained and obedient dog.You well
        not have to worry about him chewing up everything. Which puppies
        do? As I told your husband, all the pedigree papers are in
        order.You can check with the National Breeder's Association,
        both his Mother and Father were prime Show dogs and won many
        Gold Ribbons against strong competition. You can also have him
        checked out by any Veterinarian of your choice.I will hold the
        check for ten days. If you haven't contacted me by then, I will
        cash the check and the deal is closed. Does that sound fair
        enough to you? E.W. said, "Yes". Well Lee it looks like you have
        a new dog. Let's take him home to his new home. E.W. thanked
        Mr.Wells and gave him a check. After giving him the check, he
        asked, if it would be alright to bring the puppy back in two
        weeks to board over the weekend. Because of a Party
        that&nbsp;will be held at the house. Mr. Wells said; "that would
        be fine."I never knew how much my surprise cost. I only heard
        Mother say; that was an awful lot of money, E.W. He just shook
        his head and said; a boy needs a dog, especially your son. And
        you know why?<br>
        <br>
        The first couple of nights the puppy slept in the Utility room
        just off of the kitchen. And he whined all night. In the morning
        when I opened the door to the Utility room, it was a mess! Hilda
        was not a 'Happy camper'. E.W. said; we are going to have to fix
        him a place in the Garage. E.W. went about making a make-shift
        pen with a little door. The puppy bed, the food bowl and his
        water bowl were transferred to the Garage. For the next two
        nights, the whining continued. I don't know what the word might
        be or was but whatever it was Hilda said it. E.W. went out and
        bought a ticking Alarm clock and a stuff toydog. That night
        there was not a whimper.All the circles under our eyes left. The
        next morning Hilda was smiling once again. E.W. asked me if I
        had a name in mind for the new puppy, I said well yes and no, I
        can't make up my mind wither to call him 'Thor' or 'Nemo'. I
        think I will go out and see which name he likes the best. While
        we were having breakfast, Mother said your father told me that
        you had picked two names for the dog and that you were going to
        see which name the dog liked the best. So what's it going to be
        Thor or Nemo? Well, he seemed to like both of them, so I picked
        Nemo". Mother said; Mr. Jules Verne would have liked that.<br>
        <br>
        That afternoon E.W called and told Mother,that there would be a
        couple of workman who were going to fix a place for Nemo out to
        the back of the house, out next to the back wall. It would go
        the whole length of the back wall and that he had already bought
        a large dog house for Nemo to sleep in at night. He also said
        that he registered Nemo at the Dog Obedience School and that
        after he had been there for four weeks,I could attend the
        classes with Nemo. After putting the phone down; Mother said;
        your father has been a busy little bee this morning, she went on
        to tell me all that had been said. Nemo would be starting School
        before I did.<br>
        <br>
        It took the workman three days to finish Nemo's playground.
        Nemo's house arrived the afternoon the workman were putting the
        finishing touches to the enclosure. E.W. called to see if the
        workman were still there, Mother said, "Yes". "I'll be home
        shortly." I came in from watching the workman, Mother said; your
        Father is on his way home. When he got home, we all went out to
        see if Nemos' Folly' was finished. That's what Mother called it.
        The workman had just finished. It was a "big", and I mean a big
        area, E.W. said it measured almost fifty yards in length,
        running the length of the back wall and thirty-five yards deep,
        the dog house sat at one end. How do you like it, as he looked
        at the both of us? Mother was not dancing an Irish Jig. But I
        said; it's great, lets` go get Nemo and see how he likes it.
        "Good idea" said E.W. Martha, I'll go get you a chair, and you
        can wait for us to bring the little fella out. He got the chair,
        and then we went to the Garage to fetch Nemo.I carried Nemo.
        E.W. brought the food bowl, the water bowl, the stuffed toy dog
        and the Alarm clock. After a short distance, I put Nemo down and
        started running, he ran after me. We got to his new home,I
        opened the gate and walked in, and he followed. E.W. followed
        with Nemo's furnishings; the Alarm Clock and the stuffed toy dog
        were placed inside the dog house. The flooring of the dog house
        had a thick carpet on the floor and on all the sides. E.W. went
        and got some water from the fountain for the water bowl and said
        we will feed him later. We walked out and closed the gate and
        headed back towards the house.<br>
        <br>
        On the way back, E.W. said, we will go up to your Balcony and
        watch with a pair of binoculars and see what he does without us
        standing there. Mother asked Hilda to bring up some lemonade and
        some coffee to my Balcony; we are going to watch Nemo in 'Nemos'
        Folly.' E.W went and got this binoculars. We took our grandstand
        seats. E.W. handed me the binoculars and said tell us what is he
        doing now? "He's just standing at the fence looking out. Wait a
        minute, a bird just landed inside the fence. He's barking and
        chasing it. The bird went bye, bye. Now, it looks like he hears
        something, there he goes all the way down to the far end, What
        ever it was, he is no longer interested in it. He's coming back
        to his house, he getting a drink of water. Now he is going
        inside the Doghouse. It looks like he's not coming out. Maybe he
        laid down. E.W. said; well it looks like he's satisfied, he
        hasn't barked since we left him, that's a good sign. You keep
        the binoculars and take good care of them. You can check on him
        now and them. When you can go out to feed him later, make sure
        his gate is locked when you leave.<br>
        <br>
        Where were we?<br>
        <br>
        Oh, yes! The "Garden Party" where I was to be the "Guest of
        Honour". Sunday was to be the festive occasion. Two weeks prior
        to the event Mother had sent out Twenty-five (R.S.V.P.)
        Invitations which in effect said; "You all come! You are invited
        to a "Western Hoe-down" Dress code, Western.(Place, Time and
        Date) A Professional Catering Service had been hired to handle
        most of the details which included the food, beverages, extra
        chairs, tables with red chequered table cloths. All the eating
        utensils (paper plates, cups and glasses). All the chefs,
        waiters, waitresses and the bartenders were to be dressed in
        Western attire.<br>
        <br>
        The main venue for the "Shin-dig" was to be held out in the
        'back forty' (the back-yard). Sunday evening was the scheduled
        time. Come early Saturday morning a large moving van pulled into
        the driveway just after breakfast. Mother said; that must be the
        Moving Company, they have come to take all the furniture and
        rugs out of the Living-room, so that later in the morning we can
        start transforming the Living-room into a 'Western Saloon'. E.W.
        and I looked at each other and shook our heads. E.W. said; I
        think I will make myself scarce and go downtown. After the
        Moving Company was through clearing out the living-room and had
        left. Another large van pulled into the driveway. This time it
        was the Catering Service. They unloaded all their ice chests
        with the perishable food and all the other required equipment
        (tables, chairs, Kegs of beer along with the other beverages)
        All this was put in the Garage.<br>
        <br>
        Let's run the clock back just a tad. Mother had a friend whose
        husband owned a Production Design Company, where they
        constructed scenery sets for the many stage shows that came to
        town. Also on the same property was a large warehouse that
        housed hundreds of different kinds of props. You name it they
        had it from A to Z. Mother met her friend and her husband one
        day and toured the Warehouse. She told them what she was looking
        for and why? Neither E.W. nor I was aware of this visit. Come
        Saturday afternoon, a very large Truck followed by a smaller van
        pulled into the driveway. Mother said; that must be my friend
        and her husband. Let's go out and meet them before they start
        unloading. The man said; so this is Master Lee. How are you son?
        How do you like Indianapolis ? "Fine Sir!, "I would like for you
        to meet my wife." "Welcome to Indianapolis ! Your Mother and I
        were classmates at a Beautician College a few years back. I
        heard a lot about you."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Martha all that you picked out is on the truck plus a
        surprise, our gift to you and Master Lee. If you will tell my
        men where you want certain things to go, we will start unloading
        and get things ship-shape. Mother pinned on her "four stars" and
        assumed command and started asking the men to take this and
        that, here and there. The transformation of the living-room into
        a Saloon took first priority. Chairs and tables with red
        chequered table cloths were placed along the walls, eight
        manikins were dress in cowboy outfits and dance hall costumes
        and seated at the tables. The backdrop scenery panels were put
        in place one at the far end where the bar was to be. It showed
        rows of whiskey bottles on painted shelves, a Pendulum Clock and
        pegs to hold the gun belts plus an old menu and drink price list
        sign. The bar was about eight feet long with a foot rail. Two
        brass spittoons were on each side of the bar.Two large wagon
        wheels were added to the decor. Then a couple dozen red lanterns
        that had been wired for light bulbs were placed on some of the
        tables. Then the bandstand was put in place. The last five
        things to be unloaded to complete the Saloon transformation was
        the large wooden Indian Chief to be put at the Entrance of the
        Saloon and a Sign that read; "The Dirty Dog Saloon" and a
        smaller sign that said; all guns must be checked in at the Bar."
        Then three bags of sawdust were scattered on the hardwood floor.
        Martha, we have saved the best for last. All the workers
        disappeared into the large Van; I couldn't believe my Eyes,
        rolling down the ramp was a "Wells Fargo Stagecoach", just like
        I had seen in all the Cowboy Movies. It was placed on the front
        lawn and wired for lights, inside and out. Of course I
        immediately asked if I could climb inside. "Sure, Master Lee go
        right ahead and climb in. "Wow" a real live Stagecoach!" Mother
        was still in a state of shock! "What a lovely surprise." How can
        I ever thank you? How thoughtful!<br>
        <br>
        After the Saloon make-over, the workers moved to the back yard
        and began to place all the other things as Mother directed,
        there were about fifteen self-standing plywood cut-outs of some
        mean looking gun slingers. Mother had some of them placed along
        the walk-way to the Cabana and the Barbecue Pit. Two were placed
        out by the Stagecoach and one by the entrance to the Saloon. The
        two plywood mock-ups, one a standing store front building and
        the other a simulated Jail house were placed, one on each side
        of the Cabana. Bails of Hay were put here and there, as were
        some of the large wagon wheels. The rest of the wired red
        lanterns were distributed around the Barbecue area and the
        Cabana area. Mother asked one of the workers to put some Western
        clothes on the nude Lady of the Fountain. He kindly hesitated,
        one of his buddies told Mother; he's still a virgin. Better let
        a man do it. The rest of the chairs and tables were equally
        divided between the Cabana and the Barbecue areas. The three
        Western saddles that were mounted on wooden horses and the wine
        barrels were placed a short distance from the Barbecue area.
        After Mother had changed her mind several times about where
        something was to be placed( a woman's' prerogative) The backyard
        was finish.<br>
        <br>
        A horn was honking, out front. Hilda came running out, waving
        her hands like she was trying to stop an on coming train.
        "What's all the commotion about Hilda? Well ma'am there is a
        crazy man out front who says he has a "Shooting Gallery" to be
        put up in the Backyard. Did you hear that Mother a "Shooting
        Gallery" Yes I heard it. But I didn't order a "Shooting
        Gallery." Just then one of the workers yelled; Ma'am your
        husband is on the phone.<br>
        <br>
        The man out front started honking his horn again. Mother
        appeared and told Hilda to let the man unload and bring
        everything into the backyard. The man's helpers started bringing
        in the "Shooting Gallery" piece by piece. The man told Mother
        that he had been instructed that the "Shooting Gallery" was to
        be placed against the back wall of the property. Then Mother
        turned to me and said; that was E.W. on the phone telling me
        that he had rented a "Shooting Gallery" as a surprise. "Wow!, a
        real Shooting Gallery." I still couldn't believe, as I watched
        the owner and his helpers put up the Shooting booth. The owner
        asked me, if there was and electrical outlet close by. I showed
        him where it was. Then I ask him about the guns, what kind were
        they? He said; they were all "Red Rider"&nbsp; pellet guns" that
        had been modified to shoot only three pellets. I told him that
        my Grandfather had given me Red Rider pellet rifle, last
        Christmas and taught me how to shoot. Then I saw E.W. coming
        towards us. "Well, Lee what do you think about the "Shooting
        Gallery" "Great!" He turned to the owner and asked how things
        were going? "We'll, we will be through in about fifteen
        minutes."Then I asked if I could do some shooting. Let's check
        it out with your Mother first and ask the owner if it would be
        alright The owner had been listening and said it would be
        alright with him and that I could use my own gun since it was
        the same make as his guns. I ran to the house to ask Mother, she
        said okay but that she would like to watch. I ran upstairs and
        got my rifle. Mother and I walked out to the&nbsp;shooting
        booth. E.W. asked if he could shoot with me. I said, sure. The
        owner gave E.W. a loaded rifle, I had already loaded mine. The
        moving targets were turn on. It was decided that we would take
        turns. The owner would call the targets to be shot. It would
        either be a moving or a stationary one. E. W.said I could go
        first and he would follow. The owner called the target, I fired,
        it was a tiny moving metal duck that fell over if you hit it
        (duck down.) Then E.W shot(duck down) this went on for about
        five minutes neither one of us missing the called targets.
        Finally the owner said that he would call out three targets in
        succession and then we would rapid fire three shots at the
        moving targets before they disappeared. I asked if I could go
        last. E.W. raised his rifle and said to the owner start the
        targets. E.W. reloaded his rifle.&nbsp;The owner flipped the
        switch, they were moving faster than when we were taking single
        shots. E.W. missed one out of the three.I was up next. I told
        the owner; "now" I fired three rapid shots all three were direct
        hits. Mother clapped; the owner said, I have never seen anything
        like it, and I have been doing this for twenty-five years. "Who
        taught you to shoot like that son." "Both my Grandfather and my
        Uncle Harrison taught me." "I want you to do me a favour" "You
        have a pump action loader; I am going to turn on all the moving
        targets. I want you to rapid fire and see how many targets you
        can take down. Tell me when you are ready. Okay! Now! I took out
        ten with no misses and then ran out of ammo. "Son, you could
        work the Carnival circuit."<br>
        <br>
        Mother said; you haven't had any lunch. Come on, I'll have Hilda
        fix you something to eat, Mother had to tell Hilda all about my
        out shooting E.W. and what the Carney had to say. Hilda fixed me
        a bacon, tomato and lettuce sandwich and a big milk shake. Just
        as Hilda brought me my sandwich, E.W. came in and sat down.
        Hilda asked E.W. if he wanted anything. "Thank you, just a cup
        of coffee". Lee, I want you to do something for me. Come
        tomorrow night, I am going to get a couple of my business
        associates to go with me to the Shooting Gallery. When we get
        there I want you to come by and do some shooting. Hit some of
        the targets but also miss a few. I will introduce you and then I
        will say; I bet Lee could out shoot each of you. In fact I will
        bet $1000 against your$100. "Sure; I'll do it." Just then Mother
        walked in. "Do what?" Oh! Check to see if Bill is through
        cleaning up around the Gallery. As I left, I heard her say to
        E.W., You are such a sweetie! Surprising me like that. A whole
        Shooting Gallery, I am not going to asked you how much it cost
        you? Well since you are not going ask me how much it cost. I'm
        not going to ask you how much you have spent turning the Living
        room into a Saloon and putting a Stagecoach on the front lawn,
        plus all the other do-dads? I didn't hear a figure.<br>
        <br>
        Well, Mother's long anticipated evening was here at last. I know
        she must have dreamed about this moment many times in the past
        three and half years that we were separated. It was eight- o-
        clock in the evening and the Guests were arriving. Most arrived
        by taxi which helped solve the parking problem. And
        also&nbsp;later in the evening when someone got a little tipsy
        and needed a ride home.There were three official Greeters all
        dressed in White Western attire wearing Gun belts and six
        shooters. There was E.W., Mother and a little cowpoke, me.
        Mother's outfit was tailored skin tight. Her cowgirl pants had a
        strip of Rhinestones going down on the outside of each pant leg.
        Her blouse and string tie was studded with rhinestones as was
        the hat band on her Cowboy hat and her Gun belt.<br>
        <br>
        After a half an hour all the Guests were accounted for, there
        were no, no shows. I had said; "hello, so nice of you to come!"
        All the handshaking and the Darling this and the Darling that I
        was all 'shook out' I needed a stiff drink, I retreated to the
        Kitchen for a large glass of lemonade. Hilda was riding"Shotgun"
        over the Caterers to make sure everything was going as planned.
        Then the Head Wrangler (Mother) came through the Kitchen door
        and said; "where have you been. I've been looking all over for
        you. I need you to come with me." Out the kitchen door we went
        into the back-yard where all the Guests were gathered. E.W. was
        speaking, when he saw us, he said; "here he is now, the Guest of
        Honour Master Lee and my lovely wife, isn't she lovely? He went
        on to say; how happy he and Mother were&nbsp;that I was home
        with them to stay. And that he and Mother both hoped that I felt
        at home and would share in their happiness." He paused; I knew
        at that moment he was going to ask me to say a few words. Then
        it became a reality, "Lee would you like to say something." I
        thought, oh well! I stood up straight and as tall as I could get
        and said the word "something" and paused. Well, he did say, to
        say "something" Seriously though, "Good evening, Ladies and
        Gentlemen, I would like to say; "Thank you, thank you for coming
        and I am not just saying that to be nice. If you hadn't showed
        up this evening I would have probably been eating barbecue for
        breakfast, lunch and dinner for the rest of the month or maybe
        longer. So I really do thank you. Please be my Guest for the
        rest of the evening. And have a swell time!" E.W. smiled and
        winked and Mother's eyes were becoming moist. From that moment
        on I became a ham, what am. What is that they say; "The acorn
        does not fall far from the tree" I came by it naturally.I had
        been watching Mother weave her charm; some of it had rubbed off
        on me. I should have passed the hat. The applause was music to
        my ears.<br>
        <br>
        A few strange musical notes were coming from the Saloon. The
        Band had arrived and the musicians were seeing if there
        instruments were awake. After the warm-up, the first song they
        played was made famous by Gene Autry, "Back in the Saddle Again"
        Some of the Guests headed towards the Saloon. Others got a whiff
        of the Ribs grilling at the Barbeque pit and 'moseyed' over
        towards the grub. And others were enjoying their liquid diet.
        Food was the furthest thing from their minds. I saw E.W. talking
        to his business partner, Steve Hardy. As I was walking towards
        them a Young lady stopped me and put her arm around me and
        said;"you are a precious little boy. I just wanted to give you a
        hug and a kiss." Then she was gone. E.W. said; "one of your
        admirers?" He turned to Steve and said;" how come you and I
        never have a pretty young lady come over and kiss us"? By the
        way Lee, take my handkerchief; you are wearing some lipstick on
        your right cheek. I was just telling Steve about how good you
        are with a rifle. I told him about our little plan. He said;
        "when he sees me heading towards the Shooting booth, he's going
        to tell everybody he can about the challenge. So Lee, there will
        be a crowd, will that bother you? "I don't think so? While my
        Grandfather and my Uncle Harrison was teaching me how to shoot.
        They would try and distract me on purpose. They said a good
        shooter must have only one thing on his mind, the target, only
        the target." "Okay, then I am going to go and find your
        challengers. We will meet you at the Gallery".<br>
        <br>
        About ten minutes later I saw E.W. and three other men heading
        for the Shooters' booth. I slipped behind some people and then
        headed towards the Gallery a different way. Bill saw me coming;
        he knew what was going on E.W. had told him. There were three
        people shooting. None were hitting any of the targets. They
        finish just as E.W. and his friends rounded the corner. Bill
        handed me a loaded Rifle. I started shooting, one target went
        down. The second one was still standing after my second shot
        missed, the third shot found it's target. E.W. said; Lee when
        you are finished I would like for you to meet some friends of
        mine. I shook hands with each of them, as E.W. spoke their
        names. I ask if they were enjoying themselves, they answered
        "yes" in unison. E.W. said I told them the story about your
        Grandfather teaching you how to shoot and that he could shoot
        the eyes out of a rabbit or a squirrel. And that you were pretty
        good. In fact I said; that I would put up a $1000 against their
        $100,&nbsp;that you could beat each of them. One of the men
        said; you have to be kidding E.W. I'll take that bet all night.
        Bill put down four Guns on the shooting line, two for each of
        us. E.W. pulled out a wad of bills that would have choked a
        horse. He peeled off ten $100 dollar bills and handed it to one
        of the other men. My opponent did likewise and handed over$100
        dollars to cover the bet.<br>
        <br>
        Bill said to each of us; when I throw the switch you can pick up
        the rifle and start firing. There are three bullets in each
        rifle which means you have six shots. The winner will be the one
        who is the fastest and knocks down the most targets. We will
        toss a coin to see who goes first. Master Lee what do you want?
        I'll take heads" It's tails, Sir, do you want to shoot first or
        last? I'll shoot first. The man moved to the counter where the
        two rifles laid waiting for the switch to be thrown. The switch
        was thrown, the stop watch was started. The man fired and kept
        firing until both rifles were empty. Out of the six shots he
        knocked down four moving targets in eight seconds. I heard the
        clapping; I had been so intent in watching that I had not
        noticed the growing crowd that was increasing each minute. Then
        Bill said; Master Lee your turn. I took a deep breath and
        stepped up to the counter. Bill was watching me as I closed my
        eyes. He knew I did this before shooting. When I opened them he
        threw the switch. The rifle was in my hands, three rapid shots
        were fired, and then three more followed. The clock said five
        seconds, six targets had fallen. The crowd was silent and then
        it burst forth. I turned and smiled. How good it felt! Mother
        had heard the clapping and the shouting. She arrived just as I
        had finished shooting. She didn't see E.W. collecting his
        winnings. There were no other challenges. E.W. later said when
        Mother was not around. That I should have knocked down only five
        targets and taken seven seconds. Then more than likely, I would
        have had other challenges. Here this one hundred and fifty
        dollars is yours, nice shooting! The other two men bet against
        you.<br>
        <br>
        I walked over to the Barbecue area to get something to eat. One
        of the Chefs said; I heard about your shooting. Where did you
        learn to shoot like that? I told him, on my Grandfather's farm.
        He taught me how to shoot. Well everybody is talking about it,
        good job! Can I get you something to eat? Let's have a chicken
        leg and a small piece of steak with some beans and potato salad.
        On my way to a table I picked up a coke. And hoped that Mother
        didn't suddenly pop up out of the bushes, she didn't want me to
        drink coke. She said that it was not good for me. To make her
        point one day, she got a piece of raw meat and poured a coke on
        it. And it started to shrink. Her final remark;"that's what it
        does to your stomach. I looked down at my stomach. I had already
        taken a couple of swallows.<br>
        <br>
        After I had finished eating I walked back towards the house.
        People were still nodding and waving. A few stopped and said;" a
        great party!" As I reached the backdoor to the kitchen, I heard
        a voice say; "you are sure a hard one to find." I knew that
        voice. Nah! it couldn't be, I turned around, it was Jimmy's
        voice. Surprise! How? When? I called to talk with you, Hilda
        answered the phone, then your Mother got on the phone and said;
        that you were around somewhere but she didn't know exactly
        where. Then she said; I want you and your Father to come to the
        house. I'll have E.W. come and pick you up. I will not take "No"
        for an answer.I told her that Dad was out of town. Okay, you
        come by yourself. E.W. will be there in twenty minutes. I will
        not tell Lee that you are coming. It will be a surprise! Then
        she hung up before I could answer. And so here I am! E.W. walked
        up and said; were you surprised. "I sure was." Jimmy, I called
        your Father in Chicago and told him that you were staying with
        us until his returned. He said that was great! He will call
        tomorrow. "Have you had anything to eat this evening? Only
        sandwich a couple hours ago" Lee, why don't you take Jimmy out
        to the Barbecue pit. When he finishes, you can take himover to
        the Shooting Gallery. I'll join you later." We walked over to
        the Barbecue, Jimmy loaded up. I ordered some French fries.
        After we had finished, we headed for the Shooting Gallery. "You
        weren't kidding it's a real live Shooting Gallery. There were
        three people shooting, not having much luck hitting anything.
        Bill said; there is someone here that wants to talk with Master
        Lee. His name is William Bradley." You must be Master Lee, I
        heard about your shooting ability from someone who just lost one
        hundred dollars in a shooting match. When he said that you were
        only six years old, I just had to meet you. Are you really that
        good? Well, I know how to shoot. This is my friend Jimmy, Jimmy,
        Mr. Bradley, I thought maybe you would allow me to shoot with
        you? Jimmy would you mind? We can shoot afterwards. No, that's
        fine, I would like to watch. I didn't know that you could shoot
        a rifle. Just then E.W. turned up, I introduced him to Mr.
        Bradley. "Hello, E.W., I haven't seen you for awhile, thanks for
        inviting me to your son's Party." "Well, you will have to thank
        Martha, she sent out the invitations. I didn't know who was
        coming. It's good seeing again." "Lee, do you know who this
        gentleman is? "No", he gave me his Business card, but I haven't
        had a chance to look at it. Mr Bradley is the owner of the "Gun
        and Skeet Club" here in Indianapolis . And at one time he was
        the Number One Skeet Shooter "in these parts" as they would say
        in Texas . Mr. Bradley&nbsp;asked me,&nbsp;do you know what
        'Skeet Shooting' is son? "No sir." "I will let you Father
        explain it to you later." "Lee, I think you have met your match.
        E.W. said, this I have to watch." Again a crowd had gathered and
        it was growing. Someone had become the "Town Crier" and was
        spreading the word. That Master Lee and Mr. Bradley were going
        to have a Shooting Match. Many knew who Mr. Bradley was, I
        whispered to E.W. somebody should be selling tickets. This is
        better than tickets there will be a lot of betting going on , he
        said.&nbsp;He turned to Jimmy, "here is a thousand dollars go
        cover some of the bets. Jimmy joined the betting Guests, The
        thousands dollars was covered before you could say; "Holley
        Molley". Betting was fast and furious. Bill used the microphone
        and said; "Let the Match begin, all bets down and closed. Each
        Shooter will be using four separate rifles, three rounds in each
        rifle. Each will have a total of twelve shots. The winner will
        be the one who knocks down the most moving targets in the least
        time. Who wants to be first?" Mr. Bradley asked me, "Which do
        you prefer?"I said, "Last"."Okay! I will give you something to
        shoot at Master Lee." He went to the Shooting Counter, The bell
        rang the targets were on fast track. All twelve shots sounded
        like one. The large Stopwatch read twelve seconds and Bill
        announced. "Twelve targets down". I started clapping and the
        crowd joined in. "Master Lee, it is your turn, the four rifles
        are ready". I stepped to the Counter, paused, closed my eyes and
        said to myself, I hope you are watching Grandfather. I didn't
        hear the bell, the rifle was already firing. Twelve shots rang
        out. I knew I had the edge. I knew when my eyes opened the bell
        would ring, in that split second the first&nbsp;rifle was in my
        hand with three more following.&nbsp;The stopwatch read eleven
        seconds.&nbsp;Bill added his touch, he hesitated, and Mr.
        Bradley was walking towards me with his hand out. "Master Lee,
        twelve targets down in eleven seconds.&nbsp;The winner is Master
        Lee." The crowd went bananas, Jimmy was collecting, E.W. had me
        on his shoulders, Mother was crying and I was hilarious. If I
        had been of age I would have toasted my Grandfather. Mr.
        Bradley's comment; "I would not have believed it without seeing
        it. You have a Lifetime Membership at my Club, When ever you
        come, you will always be my Guest". He said to E.W. "I would
        love to teach him Sheet Shooting but I truly believe he would
        end up teaching me." Jimmy was beside himself, he handed E.W.
        the winnings. Mother shook her head and said to E.W. you
        didn't.""Think of all the Hamburgers and Chocolate Milkshakes
        that will buy" Right Lee, Right E.W.!<br>
        <br>
        Well, there was a lot of hand shaking and all that there stuff.
        E.W. said; I have run out of words to tell you how proud I am of
        you. Jimmy said; "I didn't know that you could shoot like that."
        "You want to know something I didn't know that I could shoot
        like that either, we both laughed. Mother came up to
        congratulate me. And then said; "I have told Hilda to fix up the
        spare bedroom for Jimmy. Don't stay up to late, okay. Jimmy and
        I went over to where the three Western saddles were and climbed
        up into the saddles and grabbed the lariats and tried to lasso
        the barrels. If the barrels had been cows, the cows would have
        been safe. After the lasso fiasco, we went into the Saloon and
        watched the dancing and listened to the music for a little
        while. Then we went up to my room. Boy that is some Party! Where
        did all those people come from? Mother sent out twenty five
        Invitations weeks ago. Did you know anyone that was here
        tonight? Only five, no make that six counting you. There was
        Steve Hardy, E.W.s business partner which you have met. Then
        E.W. sisters, Irma and Freda, Mother's Aunt Roxie, Mother's
        Lawyer and you. You mentioned your Mother's Lawyer, actually he
        represents E.W. He has one of the biggest Law Firms in The City.
        And his Firm handles some of the wealthiest and the most
        influential people not only in the City but in the State. The
        Firm also has one of the best staffs of C.P.A. (accountants) in
        the City. When I came in tonight with E.W., I saw the Major and
        his wife talking with the Congressman from our State. I am sure
        there were other dignitaries attending your "getting to know you
        Party". My Father says; that E.W. is connected, that he is
        behind many business deals not only in the City but also in the
        State. He also does business in Chicago , Detroit and New York .
        Originally his money came from Stock options. He owns a
        considerable amount of original stock in the Plymouth and
        Chrysler Car Companies. He also owns twenty-five percent of a
        number of businesses here in Indianapolis and elsewhere. He is
        the sole owner behind the scenes of two Downtown Restaurants and
        a Night Club. Two of the largest Car Dealerships ( Plymouth and
        Chrysler) are partly owned by E.W. He is the money behind Steve
        Hardy's Gaming Emporium. My Dad and your Stepfather have been
        business partners for a long time, long time. He owns
        twenty-five percent of Dad's Downtown Gym. My Dad is in Chicago
        right now trying to close a deal in buying a large downtown Gym.
        Your Stepfather is putting up the front money. As my Dad said;
        E.W. is connected, really connected. One last thing, if you were
        a poker player, it would be to your benefit not to get in a
        Poker game with E.W. He is one of the best there is. It is
        reputed that he stood down 'Nick the Greek' in a four day
        session of Poker in New York . That $83,000 Pierce Arrow, he
        drives was won one night in a Poker Game, with a Royal Flush. I
        probably have said more than I should have said. You have to
        promise me that you will not tell any one what we talked about
        tonight. Or I will be in deep, deep trouble. Promise! Yes, I
        promise.<br>
        <br>
        I forgot to ask you where is Nemo I didn't hear him barking as
        usual. He was boarded out. Glad you asked or I would have
        forgotten to tell you that Nemo is starting school tomorrow at
        the Obedience School . Do you want to come and watch? Sure!
        Hilda knocked and said that the spare room was ready. Okay!
        Jimmy thank you, for being my friend. Our secret is our secret.
        See you tomorrow morning!<br>
        <br>
        I looked at the clock it was six-thirty in the morning, It
        seemed as though I had just gone to sleep. I grabbed my robe and
        went down the hall and knocked on Jimmy's door and said;
        breakfast in thirty-minutes. I heard a muffled sound, "okay!"
        When Jimmy and I entered the dining-room, Mother asked; if we
        slept well. We both agreed that it was a short night. Jimmy
        asked about the party and while Mother was answering E.W. joined
        us. Mother commented that it seem like everyone enjoyed
        themselves. And that only one guest over enjoyed by falling off
        of one of the Western saddles while he was trying to lasso one
        of the cocktail waitresses and yelling, "Oh lay!" and Steve
        drove the gentleman home. E.W. said that it was a shame that we
        didn't stay up to see and hear the Finale, Mother did her
        Charleston Dance routine and sang; "When my Baby Smiles at Me"
        And as usual brought the house down. Jimmy said to Mother my
        Father says; you have a great voice and should be singing
        professionally. You tell your Father, thanks for the compliment.
        E.W. said, I have offered to get her an Agent but she says, "No
        I can sing at the Nightclubs when I feel like it, Mother
        replied, that's enough for me. E.W. said, all of you need to get
        a move on it or you are going to have to write a tardy note for
        Nemo's first day at the Obedience School . I'll get the car out
        of the garage for you. Jimmy and I went out got in the car and
        waited for Mother. Jimmy asked about Nemo's training classes, I
        told him that for the first four weeks Nemo was on his own and
        that I would be joining him after the four weeks were over. So I
        might learn what he had been taught, so I could give the proper
        commands and hand signals that he had learned.<br>
        <br>
        We arrived at the boarding Kennels where Nemo had spent the last
        two nights because of the House Party, It took about ten minutes
        to get Nemo to settle down, he was prancing, barking and wagging
        his tail off. Finally he calmed down after I rolled down the
        window so he could hang his head out. We were a little late
        getting to the Obedience School and Nemo hadn't written his
        excuse note. The attendant said that's alright we have a lot of
        dogs that can't spell! Jimmy and I looked at each other! Nemo
        was taken inside, barking his head off. I couldn't tell if his
        barking was a happy bark or a "why"barking? It kind of reminded
        me of my going to go to School my first day, because as I
        remember I was asking, why?<br>
        <br>
        As we drove away Mother said; I am sure Nemo will be alright
        after he gets use to his surroundings. I have to make a short
        visit to take care of some business I will not be long. You can
        stay in the car or come inside, it is your choice". Jimmy and I
        said in unison; "we will stay in the car". We pulled up in front
        of this fancy looking building that was landscaped with a lawn
        and flower beds with two fairly large water fountains with
        marble statues of young maidens whose clothes&nbsp; were
        missing. A doorman opened my Mother's door and asked; "how are
        you today?" Mother said; Fine, just fine." I promise I won't be
        long and then she disappeared inside. I asked Jimmy if he knew
        what this place was. He said it was a "Beauty Spa", Women come
        and stay for a month or two, hoping they can lose weight.
        Special nutritional meals and exercise routines are followed
        daily. There are also saunas and steam rooms and other different
        kinds of machines that help to reduce the weight. It also has a
        large swimming pool. The program is very expensive. The women
        are taught proper make-up techniques and hair styling. Your
        Mother owns this one and another one in the Downtown area of the
        City. Remember last night I told you that E.W. owns pieces of
        businesses. This is one of them. Your Mother also owns a
        Millinery and Dress Boutique Downtown. But as I said last night,
        this is between you and me, Mums the word! "I know I do not know
        anything!"<br>
        <br>
        After Mother's visit to the Beauty Spa, we took off to buy some
        things at the Market before meeting E.W. at the restaurant for
        lunch. When we arrived at the restaurant, E.W. was already
        seated. He asked about Nemo as to wither we got him to the
        School on time. We said; almost and then I told him what the
        attendant said about most of the dogs couldn't spell.
        &nbsp;Well, I thought it was funny. While we were ordering E.W.
        said that he had been thinking about having some remodeling done
        to the house. He asked me if I would like to have a place
        upstairs in the Garage for some gym equipment, a few weights, a
        heavy bag and a speed bag. Maybe a Ping Pong Table and a Pool
        Table. We could also put in a snack bar with some tables and
        chairs. How does that sound? It sounds okay! to me, but what is
        a Pool Table and a Ping Pong Table? E.W., asked Jimmy if he knew
        how to play Ping Pong and shoot Pool? Yes, I can play both of
        them, I am better at pool than Ping Pong. Great! Would like to
        teach Lee how to play? Sure, that would be fun. Mother finally
        got a word in edge wise. She said to E.W. you didn't tell me
        about this. Well I just thought about it this morning. Do you
        like the idea? Well, yes I am just surprised. Okay, it's
        settled, I'll call someone today and we will get started. E.W.
        then said to Jimmy and me, I am going to call a friend of mine,
        he owns the Jimmy Mc Clure's 'Ping Pong School' downtown and
        sign you both up for a membership. And see if he will give you
        both lessons. Mother kidding said: don't I get to have lessons
        too.<br>
        <br>
        The remaining of the rest of the week and the rest of the month,
        there were trades people (carpenters, plumbers, electricians and
        painters) moving in and out of the house like busy bees. Not
        only were they redoing the upper floor of the Garage area. E.W.
        had decided to redo the attic and make half of it into a gaming
        room with a Billiard table, a snack bar, a private office with a
        bedroom off of it, with an attached bath and shower. It really
        worked out perfectly with Nemo being gone for four weeks. During
        that remodeling period E.W. took Jimmy and I to go with him to
        look at the needed equipment for the upper room of the Garage
        and some of the furniture for the Attic remodeling. Mother was
        getting anxious about the noise and the disruption but E.W.
        assured her that it would all be over shortly. The day arrived
        when it was all finished.<br>
        <br>
        Mother was out, attending to some business at one of the Spa's
        the day that&nbsp;three large Moving Vans pulled up in the
        driveway, E.W. said; well all the equipment and furniture has
        arrived for the Attic and the Garage. He told the man in charge
        to unload the Van that had the equipment and furniture for the
        Attic first. First out was the bedroom furniture for the new
        bedroom in the Attic. Then the Office Furniture for E.W. new
        home Office.<br>
        <br>
        Finally the last to be moved up to the Attic was the furnishings
        for the Game room. The Billiard Table was in three sections, it
        was the heaviest of all the furnishings. Then the bar equipment
        (refrigerator, stove. et centra. Just as they were finishing
        with the Game room, a smaller van pulled into the driveway.
        Three people got out, E.W. said: these people are the Interior
        Decorators. They started taking some wall hangings, pictures,
        curtains, lamps, draperies and other accessories up to the
        Attic.<br>
        <br>
        Then the other workers were starting to unload everything for
        the new remodeled area in the Garage. Out came the Pool Table
        and the Ping Pong Table, then the furniture and finally all the
        Gym equipment. Last was the refrigerator for the Snack bar.
        Jimmy supervised the placement of the heavy bag and the speed
        bag. One of the Interior decorators came down and started
        hanging some pictures on the walls. They were Pictures of some
        of the famous fighters of the past; Dempsey, Braddock, Corbett
        and Sullivan. He also put up the Dart Board and mounted the rack
        for the pool sticks. Jimmy and I went upstairs to see how the
        Attic was shaping up. E.W. was in his new office, "well, how do
        you like it?" Great! "How is the Garage make over coming along?"
        They are about finished, just then a horn honked, E.W. said that
        must be the surprise! Come on let's go down and see it. Glad to
        see you could bring them today said E.W. The man opened up the
        Van and there were two Pin Ball machines. He said to the driver
        one goes upstairs in the Attic and the other goes in the Garage.
        The two men started unloading. Like the surprise! "Wow! sure
        do!"<br>
        <br>
        When Mother arrived home later in the afternoon, all the people
        had finished and had left. We had told Hilda that when Mother
        got home and asked where everybody was to tell her that we were
        upstairs in the Garage&nbsp;and for her to come up and join us.
        We heard the car drive up and knew she would be coming up the
        stairs. We hid in the Bathroom and left the door cracked just
        enough to see her enter the room as she came up the stairs. As
        she topped the stairs, she said: Oh! My God!! And let out a
        little shriek, we opened the door and yelled "Surprise!" Hilda
        was right behind to catch her if she fainted. "E.W., I am never
        going to forgive you, I could have had a heart attack." Then she
        pointed to Jimmy and me, you two and Hilda were in on this, I
        should have known that something was going on when Hilda said
        that you were upstairs in the Garage. "Well, E.W said how do you
        like it?" Let me sit down and catch my breath, after the pause
        Mother said: it is really something else! I am speechless! It is
        hard to believe all this was done while I was gone. Even a
        Pinball machine, E.W. you think of everything. Well boys, should
        we tell her the rest of the Story, you better sit down Martha.
        The Attic is also finished would you like to see&nbsp;it now or
        later? "I don't believe you; you couldn't have done both in one
        afternoon, could you?" Well seeing is believing, shall we go
        see?<br>
        <br>
        As we entered the Attic area, Mother said; E.W. you never cease
        to amaze me in how you get things done. She turned to Jimmy and
        me and asked; how many people were here this afternoon helping
        to do all this? Jimmy and I looked at each other: Jimmy said,
        twenty-five and I said, thirty; E.W said thirty-five counting
        the Interior Decorators. Mother walked in and out of E.W.
        office, the bedroom and walked around the Gaming area. All she
        could say was; Unbelievable! Unbelievable!<br>
        <br>
        Later in the week, a little Party was arranged; Swifty and
        Jimmy, Steve, E.W. Sisters and the Wilkinson's, Mother's friends
        that owned the Design and Production Company (where all the
        props for the earlier Garden Party came from.) During the
        evening Jimmy and I challenged E.W. and Swifty to a game of Pool
        and Ping Pong and were beaten badly. We demanded a rematch after
        one month. I told Jimmy afterwards, maybe I should have said
        after two months. Jimmy said; that means you and I are going to
        have to play a lot of Pool and Ping Pong between now and then. I
        have the solution; I'll ask Mother if you can stay here for the
        next month. Then we can practice and go to the Table Tennis Club
        together. I'll go ask Mother right now. She said that it would
        be just fine, if your Father agreed. Jimmy asked Swifty and he
        agreed, so it was all settled. Practice starts tomorrow partner.<br>
        <br>
        Among all the various activities; Nemo's lessons and the Ping
        Pong lessons, along came my Birthday and a Birthday Party.
        Somewhere in all this Uncle Harrison had called my Mother and
        asked if I could spend a couple of days at the Farm prior to my
        birthday, she agreed. He drove down and picked me up. What an
        early birthday present! As we pulled into the gate of the
        farmhouse, Shep was jumping up and down, barking his head off.
        When I opened the gate; I thought he was going lick my face off.
        Standing in the yard was Uncle Ray and his wife, my niece and
        nephew, my Father and his new wife and Uncle Harrison's wife.
        Needless to say; my eyes were getting misty along with the
        others. Shep was still jumping up and down like a jack-rabbit.<br>
        <br>
        As we entered the house, the words "Happy Birthday" came from
        the Dinning room. Some of my first grade classmates and their
        Parents had been invited. I was lost for words which was unusual
        for me. There were balloons, streamers and Party hats and all
        the trimmings. During the eating of the ice cream and the cake,
        it seemed like I answered a couple hundred questions or more
        about my life in the City. Uncle Harrison helped in answering
        some of the questions because Mother took him on a tour of the
        house when he came to pick me up. His exclamation as we were
        heading towards the farm. Boy! That's some house you live in, I
        have never seen a House that big before and your room. That Game
        Room you have in the Garage that is something else also. You are
        very lucky Harry Lee. Well back to the Party, after the
        refreshments we gathered in the Parlor. It was present opening
        time. Some of the presents were clothes; there were a few books,
        a pen and pencil set. And then the last three presents were from
        someone who I missed so very much, my beloved Grandfather. Uncle
        Harrison as he gave the presents to me said; Grandfather left
        these for you; the first present was Grandfather's Gold Pocket
        watch and chain, the second and third were two of his favorite
        guns, a 22 Remington Pump rifle and his 20 gauge shotgun. It was
        too much, I had to leave the room for a moment, tears were
        forming. My Father and Uncle Harrison came out afterwards and
        asked if I was alright, I said, "yes" but I wasn't, I returned
        and apologized. It was getting late and the guests had to be
        getting home. Hands were shook and words spoken, I thanked all
        for their coming. During all of this, Shep followed me and lay
        down beside me the whole time. Such a mixture of joy and sorrow
        but isn't that just like life?<br>
        <br>
        That night we talked and I answered many, many questions. During
        the talking, Uncle Harrison asked if I would like to go hunting
        with my new 22 rifle the next day, "yes indeed." Uncle Ray and
        Father said they would like to join us. So come the next morning
        we were off to the woods. Father never hunted, when he was a
        teen-ager, he went hunting with a friend of his and his friend's
        Father. There was a hunting accident, as his friend was climbing
        through a barbed wire fence, his gun went off and he was killed
        instantly. Uncle Ray was carrying my other present the 20 gauge
        shotgun, Uncle Harrison had his 22 rifle. Uncle Ray shot the
        first squirrel; Uncle Harrison got the next two. I changed the
        quarry, I shot two rabbits. The kill for the morning was six
        squirrels and four rabbits. I never did get a squirrel. (I
        wondered if Grandfather was watching, I remembered my
        Grandmother's words: "God is always watching.")<br>
        <br>
        After we got back, I told my Uncles that I was going to spend
        the afternoon with Shep; they agreed that was a good idea. My
        Father said; that Shep wasn't the same dog after Grandfather and
        you left. That afternoon Shep and I played in the barn, he
        watched as I did my Tarzan thing. Then we went fishing down by
        the creek and tramped through the woods the rest of the
        afternoon.That evening I spent with Uncle Harrison and his wife
        because the next morning. I would be heading back to
        Indianapolis .<br>
        <br>
        When we arrived at the house in Indianapolis , Uncle Harrison
        honked the horn, Mother and E.W. came down the steps, Mother
        asked Uncle Harrison if he wouldn't come in for awhile but he
        said that he had to be getting back. We said goodbye and Uncle
        Harrison thanked Mother for allowing me to visit. Don't forget
        your presents Harry Lee, we waved goodbye! I couldn't wait to
        show Mother and E.W. my Birthday presents. I learned much later
        that E.W. had purchased 22 Rifle for my Birthday and returned
        it, he never mentioned it.<br>
        <br>
        Well the day of days arrived, on August 28, 1934 I turned seven
        years of age and had my first Birthday party in the City, What a
        Party! There were parents and children, some of which I had
        never seen, some only briefly. Of course there was Swifty and
        Jimmy, Steve Hardy, Irma and Freda, Mother's Aunt Roxie and my
        Great Aunt. Let's not forget the two Clowns that E.W. hired that
        put on a Magic Show and afterwards&nbsp;made Animal Balloons.
        The Party was at 12 noon. We played the usual Birthday party
        games; Pin the tail on the donkey, divided teams did the chin
        and orange passing and the passing of the egg perched on a spoon
        held between the teeth. And then came the Birthday Cake and the
        Ice Cream, accompanied with blowing out the candles and the
        Happy Birthday song, followed by the opening of all the presents
        and I do mean all. I had never seen so many presents. I will
        list but a few; a large Erector set, a Crystal Radio Kit, Comic
        and Big Little Books, Zane Grey's Cowboy Stories. Other books;
        The Last of the Mohicans, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Hunch back
        of Notra Dame along with a renewed Subscription to The National
        Geographic and many, many Clothes, (no feathered hat), for the
        up and coming School year that was just around the corner. And
        the icing on the Cake" that evening, going to the Lyric Theatre
        to see W.C.Fields and Mae West in "My Little Chickadee" and a
        Stage Show featuring Ted Lewis and his Band (see,
        www.hawkwalk.com/ppp/p-happy.html ) As I was getting ready for
        bed , I knew that my dreams just had to be happy that night on
        my seventh Birthday.<br>
        <br>
        Three days later, Jimmy and I were walking to the opening day of
        the School year. Jimmy had spent the night before over at my
        house. We had breakfast around seven. The final School bell rang
        at eight. We were approaching the front entrance at about seven
        forty- five. It was then I saw the two boys that had beaten me
        into the ground, standing at the entrance. I told Jimmy the
        situation. His remark; I will take care of the other boy if he
        makes a move, it's your call. "Well, well, if it isn't sissy
        boy. I've been waiting for you. You and I have some unfinished
        business". He took one step but my step was quicker, I was in
        close, I ducked the punch and went for the rib cage with a right
        and left to his mid-section, he gasped. I shifted my weigh to my
        left side and brought my right hand up underneath his chin, his
        knees buckled then I caught him with a left hook to the middle
        of his face. I heard the bone crack. He was going to have
        trouble breathing for a while. Meanwhile Jimmy had put the other
        boy on the ground. The whole incident was over in less than two
        minutes. Jimmy and I walked towards the steps leading into the
        School and never looked back. Later, when we arrived home from
        School; E.W., Swifty and Mother were all in the Living-room.
        E.W. asked; "how was your first day at School, anything
        interesting happen?" Almost in unison we both said; no"! Ummh!
        Swifty said;" we had heard a rumour that two boys were taken to
        the School Nurse's office. One had a broken nose and the other a
        cut lip and a black-eye. I turned to Jimmy and said you only
        told me you gave him a black-eye. "Not bad a cut lip also."<br>
        <br>
        E.W. said to me; I understand the circumstances and the action
        taken. I have no quarrel with that. I would only add that if a
        similar situation occurs, you need to take it outside the
        School's property. Also in the future if at all possible try to
        settle the dispute without shedding blood, okay! By the way, how
        are you and Jimmy coming along with your Ping Pong lessons? Are
        you getting any better? I haven't had a chance to call the owner
        and ask. Well, I am still getting beat under the table; I really
        could use longer arms but I am learning. Jimmy and I need an
        extension of that one month for a rematch. Swifty said; I think
        E.W. and I can give you a two month lee-way, right E.W. Okay
        E.W. said laughingly since there is no money riding on the
        rematch. Mother chimed in; I don't want to hear that you and
        Swifty are taking advantage by betting against the boys. Both of
        you should be ashamed of yourselves. Whoa! Martha, we were just
        kidding! E.W., I will see you early tomorrow morning. Come on
        Jimmy we have to go. As they were leaving Jimmy yelled back, see
        you tomorrow, I'll meet you in front of the Drugstore at 7:30
        before school starts.<br>
        <br>
        After dinner Mother came up to my room before bedtime and asked
        about my classes and my teachers at school? They are okay, I
        guess, it's really too early to say. One of the teachers said
        that she had met you when you came to register me for School and
        gave them my first grade records from the Fillmore School . Some
        of the classes are quite different than at the Fillmore School ,
        one of them is called 'Music Appreciation' and the other was an
        Art Class. Well, Mother said I hope you do not get bored like
        you did in the First grade. How is your Crystal Radio working
        that you received for your Birthday? Fine, Jimmy helped me to
        assemble it, would you like to listen to it? After listening
        Mother said that's great! How far away are some of the stations?
        I picked up Chicago one night. Don't stay up to late listening.
        See you at breakfast, get a good nights' sleep. Sleep came easy
        it had been a busy day.<br>
        <br>
        September became a busy month along with school and spending
        some time with Nemo practicing the signals and the commands he
        had learned at the Obedience School . And then there were the
        Ping Pong lessons that Jimmy and I were taking. Along with the
        practicing of pool, so Jimmy and I could beat Jimmy's Father and
        E.W. Near the end of September, Mother was called to come to my
        School. After her visit to the School she told me the reason.
        She had met with the Superintendent and several of my Teachers,
        it was suggested that I be placed in the fourth grade, skipping
        the second and third. Mother said she understood the reason for
        such a move but that she felt that even though I could do the
        work of a fourth grader. I would lose two years of needed
        emotional growth plus physically I would be behind in eye /hand
        coordination and size when it came to sports. She then asked if
        it would be possible if I could attend various fourth Grade
        classes and still retain my second grade home room with children
        of my own age. And that she would employ a tutor for me so I
        could take some subjects that were more advanced. Along the line
        of my interests. This was agreed upon. One of the teachers; the
        music teacher told my Mother that I had a perfect pitched
        soprano voice and an ear for music. And that she had a friend
        who was the Choirmaster for the downtown Christ Episcopal Church
        that had a 100 Men/boys membership Choir. And that he was always
        on the look out for good voices. She went on to say that she
        would be happy to call her friend and set up an appointment.<br>
        <br>
        The following Monday afternoon&nbsp;an appointment was set to
        meet with Mr. Heath, the Choirmaster of the big Episcopal Church
        located near to the Columbia Club on the Circle in Downtown
        Indianapolis. We were ushered into his office. After
        introductions were made, he said; a good friend of mine told me
        that you have an exceptional voice and range plus a good ear for
        music, shall we see? Would you do me a favour and come with me
        over to the piano. Do you know the scale? Yes, Sir. I will play
        it once and then you sing it back to me. We did it two or three
        times then he said I am going to raise it an octave higher. I
        will play it once then you repeat it back to me. We did the new
        notes the same amount of times. Good he said; now I want you to
        take this little xylophone, I will play a note on the piano and
        then you will play the note I played. Okay! "Okay!" But first I
        want you to hit all the notes on the Xylophone and remember
        them. He played random notes and I repeated them. Then he played
        a half of dozen notes all at once. After several times of this.
        He turned to my Mother and said; has he ever had any training in
        music or voice? Mother said "No" Then he asked my Mother if she
        sang. She replied, yes, I do, but not professionally. Do you
        read music? No I sing by ear. Would you sing something for me
        without a piano? I will try but it is not a Church song? That's
        quite alright. Mother sang, "When My Baby Smiles at Me." He
        said; you should sing professionally. You and your son have
        perfectly pitched voices. A rarity indeed.<br>
        <br>
        I need your son's voice for the Choir. I would ask for yours but
        it's and all male Choir, sorry! We practice two evenings a week
        and we have two Sunday Morning Services. Occasionally we present
        special Sunday evening Music. Come Easter time and Christmas
        time the music program increases as you might well understand.
        There are also those times when the Choir gives Special
        concerts. Your son will be paid as a Choir member and will also
        be paid as a soloist. I will not only be his Choirmaster, I will
        be his teacher. I have listened to many voices over the years;
        your son has a gift. It would be a shame to waste it.<br>
        <br>
        On the way home, Mother asked if I thought I was going to enjoy
        singing in the Choir. " I think it will be fun." When we got
        home E.W. asked; how did it go? Mother filled him in. And I
        added; they are going to pay me some money for singing. How
        about that? E.W., Mother said, maybe we can even get you to come
        to Church and hear Lee sing. We'll see, but as I have told you
        many times. If I do go to Church, it is liable to fall flat to
        the ground. The phone rang, it was Jimmy reminding me it was
        'Ping Pong' lesson time.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        October came fast, maybe because September was so busy? I had
        sung my first solo during a Communion Service at the Church, the
        song was "The Lord's Prayer" and E.W. came to the Church that
        Sunday and I didn't notice a crack in the ceiling. I was not
        aware at the time that I would receive a telephone call the
        following Monday morning from the Producer of A Radio Show
        called the "Library Hour". After Mother hung up, she said that
        we had an appointment at the Radio Station (WIRE) at four in the
        afternoon. Mother picked me up after School. When we arrived at
        the Radio Station, we were met by the Producer of the Show and
        his assistant. During the conversation he mentioned the fact
        that he and his wife were in attendance at one the Church
        services on Sunday.and after he and his wife had returned home.
        He told his wife I want that young man to be part of the Library
        Hour each Saturday afternoon (two songs each program). At this
        point Mother asked if to start with, could it be but one song
        and increase it to two songs the following month, This was
        agreeable to the Producer. He went on to explained the format of
        the program, it was basically two book reviews. I would sing in
        between the book reviews and after the first month, I would
        close the Show with a song. I was to receive Twenty-five dollars
        per. song. The Producer asked Mother if that sounded fair? She
        agreed! Later when I told Mr.Heath about it. He told me that the
        producer had come to him after the Sunday service and ask about
        me. He told him he thought I would be just fine.. </font><br>
