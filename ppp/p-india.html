              Verdana, Arial;">What has not been said about India? That
              has not already been said. Many of the ills of Africa
              which I wrote about on the web-site. Have a close
              similarity to that which one finds in India. The stark
              difference is due to the bludgeoning population of one
              billion people.
              <p>As one walks into the greater cities of India, one is
                overwhelmed by the masses. A sea of people sweeps down
                the streets in every direction. Like a "People lava"
                that moves in mass, collecting people, taxi's, cows,
                cars, buffalo carts, mechanized rickshaws and an
                occasional herd of goats, in its' path. Humanity is
                lined up toe to toe in all sizes, shapes and color.
                Space is filled immediately, till there is no space.
                Everybody is breathing down everybody else's neck. This
                mass reaches a highly critical stage come mid-morning
                and then again from four to nine in the evening. If you
                happen to be caught out in these two peak times of the
                day, just grin and bear it. And join the masses.</p>
              <p>India shares the same aliments that is found in many of
                the developing countries of the world where there is a
                great diversity in languages, religions, customs, and
                traditions and class stratification. The litany is a
                common one; abject poverty, a high rate of illiteracy,
                unemployment plus a pervasive corruption that staggers
                the imagination. And a lack of infrastructures that
                covers the waterfront; i.e., hygiene and sanitation,
                sufficient educational facilities to teach the young for
                the 21st. Century and beyond. Then we have the roads;
                those needed arteries in and out of the cities and
                villages. Roads did I say, they are more like a crater
                field or a large washboard, running snake like with no
                rhyme or reason.</p>
              <p>India, not unlike so many other countries is trying to
                create a "good society". A society that promotes and
                engenders a "balance, a harmony and a peace" among it's
                citizenry and it's neighbors whoever they might be. A
                society that recognizes the inalienable rights of each
                of its' citizens. A society that is free from all those
                constraints that are detrimental to the well-being of
                its' constituents. A society that is aware that it's
                very life, it's very strength lies in the knowledge, in
                the actually that if one, only one individual is not
                free to choose his or her destiny. Then that society is
                found wanting. If one individual is denied the fruits of
                his or her labor. Again that society is found wanting.
                If anyone is denied the basic, needed essentials of
                food, water clothing and shelter to keep life and limb
                together. Then that society is found wanting. If anyone
                is denied the opportunity to be educated, to gain the
                needed knowledge and skills to earn a livelihood. Then
                that society is found wanting. If anyone is denied the
                right to perform any job, profession or task because of
                sex genders, religious preferences, creed or doctrine,
                race or color. Then that society is found wanting.</p>
              <p>Society must protect and set into practice those
                necessary measures and implementations that will uphold
                the unalienable rights of all its' peoples. Assuring
                them their equity and needed justice.</p>
              <p>It should be apparent to all that if one suffers in any
                manner, all suffer. All are responsible. Everyone's
                error, is the error of "separateness". If any society
                continues to practice this "separateness"; conflict and
                confusion will prevail not only in the lives of its'
                citizen &nbsp;but also throughout the planet.</p>
              <p>Exclusivity must give way to inclusiveness. This is not
                to say or to propose that there will be no delineation
                or differences among the people of a given society. Or
                that each individual is not held responsible for his or
                her merit or contribution to the greater good of said
                society. Freedom or any other of ones' inalienable
                rights is not a license to do nothing and receive
                something. The daily social abuses and the
                discriminating actions against individuals wherever they
                take place, must be aborted. All inhuman acts must be
                exposed and righted. All perpetrators must be held
                accountable for their actions and their identity made
                public.</p>
              <p>As a civilization, we are over due, well past the point
                of tolerating any and all actions, all crimes against
                humanity. Enough is enough! Equity and justice for all
                must prevail. The line must be held!</p>
              <p>This does not mean that the rich must take all their
                possessions and give to the poor, as some profess. Or
                distribute everything equally. But it does mean that for
                those who have been given much, much is expected of
                them. It does mean that love, concern and caring are
                essential for a "good society". And these qualities are
                to be the basics, part of the building blocks. If we
                seriously and sincerely believe we are "One". That we
                are the world.</p>
              <p>Can this happen? "Yes"! Will it happen? I say;"Yes" to
                the cynics and skeptics of the world. There is and there
                has been a growing consensus, a growing "awareness" that
                humanity cannot continue to ignore the need to come
                together and to co-exist in our diversity. Pluralism is
                an actually and it can be our strength.</p>
              <p>How can this all come about? Education, education,
                education! Every newborn child must have the opportunity
                to receive the best education available. Whether this is
                in the bush, the jungle, or the cities.</p>
              <p>But not only should we be concerned about the child's
                need to be educated. But the parents and the extended
                family who contribute to the nurturing of the child.
                Need to enter into this educational dialogue with the
                children. So they can interact with the child. Which
                would entail adult educational classes from a tutoring
                center within the community. Manned by competent and
                skilled tutors with the needed ways, means and
                instruments. Too accomplish the goals both short and
                long ranged. With daily feedback and evaluation of said
                goals. Always remembering that any problem has its'
                solution within the problem.</p>
              <p>The training of qualified teachers and administrators,
                along with the building of the needed facilities for
                both the training for qualified teachers and supervisors
                needs to be the first priority. Then comes the building
                of the needed facilities and the tools, to teach the
                children. While at the same time the development of a
                curriculum that is relevant to the child, the community
                and the world in general. All educators need to ask
                themselves; How can the children of today be equipped to
                live in this time and space? What is needed to educate
                the children of now and the future? So they can live in
                balance, harmony and peace throughout their lives. And
                reach their highest potentiality and possibility.</p>
              <p>We are nearing that time in the history of humanity
                when technology will supply us with the needed
                communication expertise via personal language
                translators which will allow us a means to teach all
                peoples in their own language as we speak. Once, we have
                this capability. Then the number one priority of the
                world should be to bring education to every child in the
                world regardless of who or where they are. The G-7
                nations, along with the World Banks should arrange for
                the needed funds it would take to educate all children
                in each of the respective countries where the illiteracy
                rate is below 90 per cent. And the educational
                curriculum that is developed for each of these countries
                which are involved needs to be adequate enough, so that
                the child is equipped for the century they are borne
                into. Reading, writing and arithmetic is not adequate
                for today's world.</p>
              <p>This must be a worldwide bipartisan effort that rises
                above all political considerations and territorial
                conflicts. How many speeches down through the years have
                contained these words? "The future of the world lies in
                our children". It is about time, we put our monies where
                our mouth is. Until this priority is taken seriously by
                the world community And consummated. The woes of the
                world will continue to compound. We know that the
                existing illiteracy must be eradicated if the world
                community is to be one of balance, harmony and peace.</p>
              <p>The piecemeal approach we are doing at the present is
                better than nothing. But one might compare it with
                emptying the ocean with a teaspoon.</p>
              <p>The United Nations, IMF and the World Bank, all the
                "Think Tanks" of the World, the best minds of all the
                Disciplines, the Legislative bodies of all the Nations.
                And the "movers and shakers" of all those
                Non-Governmental Organizations, which are doing
                something now in, the educational field for the
                developing countries. Need to pool their know how, all
                their skills and techniques and work together as one
                driving force, laying aside their ego's and power
                structures and find the solution to this world
                illiteracy and "just do it". That's if we still believe
                the future of our world lies in the hands of our youth.</p>
              <p>There has to be a radical transformation in the World's
                consciousness level. Which can come about, if we as a
                people will become aware and receptive to the actually
                that each of us is the world, in the strictest sense. It
                is necessary that we accept the reality that a better
                world, a better society starts at our front doorstep. In
                all conscious, we have to stop blaming everyone and
                everything for the chaos, disorder, confusion, conflict,
                fears and sorrows of our world. And own up, that we are
                the problem, because of the pettiness of our lives.
                Notwithstanding, the disorder, fear, anxieties, greed
                and self-indulgences which we harbor.</p>
              <p>Then add to this mix our lack of compassion, concern
                and caring for the conditions we have fostered and given
                life too. Which has made us less than human. Until we
                perceive, become aware that we are the culprits of the
                world's woes. And stop proclaiming;" The devil made me
                do it". Or it is the governments', the liberals, the
                conservatives, or them, those and they, are the reason
                for the World's problems. The World will continue on in
                its' conflict and confusion.</p>
              <p>The paradox of all this; is that the greater majority
                of all peoples regardless of their ethnicity, know in
                glimpses that they are less than they are and that they
                can be much, much more than they are. But our fears and
                our feelings of not being secure, binds us. Therefore we
                are afraid to take on the responsibility of being the
                best we can be.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>To give up the shrouds of yesterday and don the clothes
                of the "Now". We need to stop living in the "Past" or
                the "Future". Our heritage is to be the best we can be
                "Now". And just possibly, come to the self-realization,
                to the reality, that all peoples are "one". That we are
                "One" with "all and everything". We are a family. And
                that we are strong as the weakest link. It is as true as
                it was when these words were first spoken. "Divided we
                fall, united we stand".</p>
              <p>Quickly, and I hope not unfairly, just a few
                observations from a westerner. Let me start with an
                extract from a speech given by Dr.B.R.Ambebkar: "That
                religion which allows one to touch a foul animal but not
                a man is not a religion but a madness. "That religion
                which says one class may not gain knowledge, may not
                acquire wealth, may not take up arms, is not a religion
                but a mockery of man's life. "That religion which
                teaches that the unlearned should remain the unlearned,
                that the poor should remain poor is not religion but a
                punishment".</p>
              <p>The Indian Constitution of 1950 made all Indians equal
                before the law. The principal of "one man, one vote" led
                to "caste ism", political representation on a caste
                basis. By shrewd manipulation, the dominant castes have
                the means to benefit. In turn increasing the caste
                conflict. The horrifying misuses of the caste system is
                unjust, abusive, morally and ethically without rational
                and justification. A form of apartheid perpetrated by
                Indian against Indian. Black skin does not equate mental
                status. Which, the Western world finally learned.</p>
              <p>Secondly, three little words: "efficiency, quality and
                service". I am aware that unemployment is a very large
                problem in India. But to have five or ten people to do
                what one could do and do it efficiently. Is a waste of
                time and effort. And if we were to tie this in with
                quality, instead of quantity. Along with that pivotal
                business word, service. We would have the needed
                ingredients for less conflict, chaos and disorder in the
                work- a-day world of India.</p>
              <div>And lastly, and probably the greatest problem of all,
                the education of the peoples of India. Every legislator,
                every politician, every social leader, educator,
                religious leader and the man on the street, needs to
                make the education of India., the number one priority of
                the country. And keep it at the top of the priority list
                of the country. Until all the children of India have the
                opportunity to be educated. In another twenty to
                twenty-five years India will have another billion
                people. What then!</div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </span>
            <div><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">What then?
                Then one would hope that more than just three percent of
                India's' population would be paying taxes. Which is not
                only a staggering fact. But unbelievable! The poor have
                nothing to tax and the rich keep two sets of books. And
                as always the burden ends up with a small middle-class
                ratio.</span></div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">
              <p>Before bringing this verbal walk through India to a
                close. The author would like to express his gratitude to
                the peoples of India that he met along the way, as to
                their generosity and hospitality. So often I am asked,
                how was India, did you like it? And my reply is; "I love
                the people". But to use a youthful expression, "the
                government sucks"! I have never been so down as I was
                after leaving India. The ineffectiveness of the
                government and its' officials are criminal when it comes
                to solving the bludgeoning problems of India. Problems
                that cover the waterfront, all encompassing problems
                that affect every sector of Indian life. And resignation
                is certainly not the answer. Nor the oft-given answer:
                "What can be done, we have a billion people". What a
                cop-out!</p>
