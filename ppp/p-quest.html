        <tr>
          <td valign="top" align="left"><span>During a speaking
              engagement wither it be to a professional group or to some
              civic organization. A school (Primary, or Secondary) or to
              a College or University. Or sometimes to an impromptu
              gathering. that someone has arranged; one central question
              surfaces, although it is expressed indirectly in many
              different ways. All roads somehow lead to "Love, Marriage
              and the Family". This is partly due to the nature of this
              trek around the World. And the years involved in its'
              completion. Which often brings forth the questions; "What
              does your wife or family think about this long odyssey?"
              Are you lonely, do you miss your family? Are you happy,
              are you at peace with yourself?"</span>
            <p>Plus; those times when I am responding to someone who has
              heard by word of mouth, or read it in a Newspaper article,
              that I have been married a number of times, four to set
              the record straight. I am always slightly amused by the
              fact that both the News and the TV reporters in their
              interviewing are so fascinated with this same line of
              questioning. That the journey almost becomes secondary.
              Seldom do they miss mentioning the marriages in the
              article or on the air. This same fascination holds true in
              gatherings; if there is prior knowledge of my trips to the
              altar. The person who ends up asking the question can
              hardly wait until the "question and answer" period
              arrives. So they can pop the sixty-four thousand dollar
              question. I usually side-step the question, for the simple
              reason; I have limited time. If the gathering is small and
              time is not a factor. Then I answer.</p>
            <p>Let us first deal with two of the lead up questions,
              before dealing with the central issue. As sort of a run-up
              to, a prelude if you like.</p>
            <p><b>Question: "Are you happy and at peace with yourself?"</b></p>
            <p>Well, I can say that I am no longer beset upon by all the
              anxieties and fears that cause a numbing of the mind and
              spirit. That so quickly can rob one of life and its'
              abundance. Am I happy? Personally, yes! Collectively, most
              of the time. But what I see and hear as I walk in and
              around this big beautiful World of ours, does pull and tug
              at the hearts strings, now and then, causing me both pain
              and sorrow. For we the citizens of this World can sink
              down into the most abysmal levels of degradation. And
              then, there are those moments when we go and play among
              the stars. There is no doubt that we become our own worst
              enemy at times. Are we not a "puzzlement?"</p>
            <div>I am always aware, in the presence of suffering. But if
              the suffering is self-inflicted; brought on by the
              persons' own decision and effort. In doing those things
              which are unnecessary as opposed to doing those things
              which are necessary. Which in more cases than not, one
              knows the difference. Here my compassion level dips.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>Our tendency to help in these circumstances, hinders
              more than it helps. Self-esteem, self-respect and
              self-reliance is a personal matter. You cannot give these
              things to anyone. These things are given by oneself to
              oneself. In to many instances our helping ends up in
              developing a co-dependency relationship. The caretakers of
              the world have a hard time in balancing this dilemma. If
              we can help someone to the point that they will no longer
              need our help in the future, so they are self-sustaining:
              standing on their own feet, so to speak. The task is
              completed.</div>
            <p>Please excuse the detour. Back to the question: Am I
              happy?</p>
            <p>Why wouldn't I be happy and at peace with myself. I speak
              to the wind, touch the stars and play hide-seek with the
              sun. And when I am thirsty; I drink the healing waters of
              life. When I am hungry; I have the food of the "Spirit of
              Truth", that satisfies my hunger. I am in the truest sense
              a child of "All and Everything". A Citizen of the World.
              As a whole; I am a gentle warrior but can become a fierce
              warrior when the situation warrants it.</p>
            <div>So let's get on as we work towards the "sixty-four
              thousand dollar question". It is said that "Love and
              Marriage" go together like a horse and carriage.
              'Tis,true, so true! "You can 't have one without the
              other." Well, in reality you can, for to&nbsp;many do. For
              that which is taken for love flees the scene; when
              marriage walks in the front door, hand and hand with the
              World and Mr. Reality. The stars that fell, start
              returning back to the sky. And "Our Love Song" often
              becomes "What song"?</div>
            <p>But for a moment let's stay with the analogy. That love
              and marriage go together like a horse and carriage. If
              there is a horse and carriage, usually their is the
              coachman, the driver. That person which looks after both
              the horse and the carriage. He sees that the horse is
              properly nourished and groomed. And that the carriage is
              functioning and running smoothly. If he is a good
              coachman, he knows how to handle both the carriage and the
              horse, expertly in all situations.</p>
            <p>In the above illustration, it is the coachman [i.e.,man
              and woman]. that brings together two differing entities
              (the horse and the carriage) to work in tandem, in balance
              and harmony. Each doing what each does best, so that a
              particular destination might be reached. Could we not
              speak in a similar fashion, about 'love and marriage'. In
              that these two entities {Love and marriage} can
              also&nbsp;be brought together,&nbsp;under the care, skill
              and expertise of the wife and the husband so that each of
              their destinations both individually and collectively can
              be reached.</p>
            <p>A quick insert before we move into the rest of the story.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love is not a
                word, it is an action.</span> Not a re-action but a
              pro-action. To love; in Reality means...</p>
            <p>That the person who is doing the loving is "Love." He or
              she becomes love, they are in the image of "Love". They
              can only love. Any other action that is a contradiction to
              this, is not love. May I repeat; love at its' deepest,
              most sincere level, "becomes Love, is Love. In this
              transformation, one becomes and is, "Love" personified.
              Any thought, feeling or emotion that is not of this
              "Love". Is counter-productive to this "Love-Reality".</p>
            <p><b>Question: You have been married four times. Why? Are
                you still in favor of marriage? And what do your
                children and grandchildren think about this walking
                expedition you are on. Do you miss them?</b></p>
            <p>Which one would you like for me to answer first? Better
              still let me choose. "Am I in favor of marriage. In a way
              all the above questions are interrelated. Yes!, I am in
              favor of marriage. But I would quickly add, getting
              married for all the right reasons, Which is easily said,
              but rather difficult to do, especially when the hormones
              are operating at Mach speed. To many I am afraid, get
              married to just get out of the house. Some, to leave
              de-humanizing and abusive conditions. Others to just gain
              their freedom. Some get married for security reasons; to
              have someone to take care of them. Others to have
              children, to perpetuate the lineage. Others because of
              pressure from families, peers, society, or the clock is
              ticking. Some out of boredom, or loneliness. These are but
              a few of the reasons.&nbsp;For the influences are not
              always so cut and dried, they overlap at times.</p>
            <p>Hey!. What about love? "What has love got to do with it"?
              I guess I would ask what kind of love are we talking
              about? Puppy-love, infatuation, "he loves me , he loves me
              not", or the moon, croon and June, type of love. What
              about sex? What has sex got to do with it? Well, one might
              say, if we were to be candidly honest about it. That the
              prime motivating factor at the onset of a relationship; is
              to a greater degree sexually based. Now, I am not a died
              in the wool Freudian student; who believes that all of
              life centers around the genitalia. But realistically
              speaking sex is one of the most powerful influences that
              touches every bit of human space. If a census could be
              taken and each gender would be perfectly honest with
              themselves. They would probably agree; that most
              relationships and marriages. Are consummated by decisions
              made below the belt line, in varying degrees. Sexual
              attraction; psychological arousal and a desire for a
              closeness, an intimacy with another. All seem to be the
              gravitational pull towards the opposite sex. I am
              convinced that our need to be loved, accepted and to
              belong to something, or someone coupled with the sexual
              nuances are the main elements. The over-riding factors or
              forces that come to play in all or in most all gender
              relationships. Be they of a casual nature or one of
              a&nbsp;more committed mature relationship that reaches
              beyond the immediate physical fulfillment and
              gratification. Too, a more integrated and complete
              "wholeness", a "communion" with another.</p>
            <p>One of the great illusions that we have created through
              the media hype. Is the myth, that "love conquers all". We
              want so badly to believe this. We like the words " and
              they lived happily ever after". We want the Hollywood
              script endings in life, where the two lovers walk hand and
              hand into the sunset. We feel cheated if the ending turns
              out any different. Most of us are incurable romantics,
              well maybe not most of us but a good many. But in the
              daylight of reality, we learn that the meaning of love is
              deeper by far than any ocean. It is an "inherent gift" and
              it is the best of us. And if we choose to accept love it
              demands the very best of us. To paraphrase or to add a
              different spin to a phrase use by John F. K. "It is not
              what love can do for us, but rather what we can do for
              love and with love."</p>
            <div>I have said it elsewhere but I will say it again as I
              am prone to do; " I ,me, mine and my are four pronouns
              that would best be left at the doorsteps of a
              relationship. For in doing so it would help us to realize
              a much needed quality for our relationships with our loved
              ones, friends, associates and yes, even the stranger.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>A quality which speaks to; that which is the more
              excellent for our loved ones, friends, associates and all
              those we come in contact with. To make this a reality
              involves a commitment, a responsibility and a passionate
              intent towards this end. If this posturing and "Willed
              Intent" is to be achieved.</div>
            <p>Is there an answer to the question:" What is love all
              about?" Yes! Love is all about ones' giving; a giving out
              of oneself. The giving of "who and what" we are, the
              giving of that which is the best, the more excellent of
              ourselves to our loved ones. A giving out of concern and
              compassion for the well-being of all. A love that carrys a
              commitment to give of those things that are the most
              conducive for the growth and evolution of those we love.
              If this is not a vital part of our love giving, love is of
              little value. Love gives, because love cannot help but
              give. It is its' nature. The giving of the more excellent
              of ones' self. So that the loved one might have a life
              that is abundant. A life that is alive and aware, that is
              the "color of joy and the sound of music". There is no
              greater gift that one can give than the giving of who and
              what one is. That is why it is so important for each of us
              to hear and understand:&nbsp;<strong>" Know thyself. "</strong></p>
            <p><span>As we have said elsewhere. It is difficult to give
                water to the thirsty, if the well is dry. Or food to the
                hungry, if the pantry is bare. One needs to asks; "
                where are those treasures of the self "? We are reminded
                of those words. "Silver and gold I have not, but what I
                do have I will give you." &nbsp;Love must bring
                something to the table. And that something must be more
                than the desert. Regardless of how delectable it might
                be. The love, we have been speaking of has little to do
                with the giving of the silver and gold, or the "Cherries
                Jubilee", we so feverishly seek after. It has to do with
                ones' heart. Where ones' heart resides is where ones'
                treasures are.</span></p>
            <p>I am convinced that when "right-ness" becomes written in
              the mind, heart and spirit. And we become and be right
              with "all and everything. We will have no need for
              mandates and laws. We will be these things. Just as if,
              and when we can come to our senses and love with all our
              mind, heart, soul and strength. The need for marriages and
              divorces will cease to be. And all our relationships will
              be in and of&nbsp;love. An unconditional love. Which we
              will discuss at another time.</p>
            <p>Now for that sixty-four thousand dollar question. That
              raises the eyebrows and starts the chattering; "Did you
              know? Have you heard? And he was a 'man of the cloth', did
              you ever, how was that possible?</p>
            <p>Why four trips down the 'rose-petalled' lane? Would you
              settle for, "I am a slow learner". No, I didn't think you
              really would. I said earlier that many, to many decisions
              to get married. Have to do with attraction, physical
              arousal and a decision made below the belt line. And I
              guess we could throw in, which would be true for some. A
              "collective romanticism" that exists via poem, song,
              movies and centuries of story telling. You know ; "the
              little white cottage with the white picket fence and
              communal bliss". Am I a cynic, far from it? Do I believe
              in marriage, again yes!. But only when each after marriage
              [purposely) live apart, in separate apartments or houses
              and date each other as lovers and friends. (Just having a
              thought, a fantasy) If the truth was known; there are to
              many couples who are living apart while staying married.
              For all sorts of crazy reasons; they think differently,
              act differently, and want different things. Happiness for
              them, is when the spouse leaves town for a day or two or
              more. Misery is when he or she returns. They are like two
              people riding on a train together, looking out of two
              different windows. How many have accepted
              this;&nbsp;calling this "love and marriage? When in truth
              they are just tolerating each other.</p>
            <p>Well back to the question.</p>
            <p>In the first marriage, Alana was eighteen , I was
              twenty-six; eight years is a lot of difference when the
              young lady in question knows the World in part, only by
              looking out through her parents' eyes, or the windows of
              the old homestead. And the young man is a veteran of WW
              II, street wise and traveled. The physiological and
              psychological arousal and attraction, were the main
              factors that initiated the relationship. We had three
              dates and steamed up all the windows. I left for Las
              Vegas, wrote love letters that toasted the paper. Finally
              asking Alana to fly to Las Vegas to get married. I had
              never met her parents who were living in Atlanta, Georgia.
              I had only met an aunt, who Alana was visiting in Houston
              at the time. I was living next door. But, I am fairly sure
              that Alana would agree, we were lovers, not companions. We
              were as different as "night and day". If you are
              interested in any further history. Check the "Macro-Bio".</p>
            <p>The second and&nbsp;fourth&nbsp;were also relationships
              fanned by the winds of passion that consumed anything and
              everything in its' path. All sensibilities and caution
              ceased functioning. My "Achilles" heel surfaced again,
              laying to waste all logic and rationality. Once again my
              weakness for love, for loves' sake came front and center.
              And I walked into the fire; cogent of the possible
              impending consequences. But as usual with a naive hope and
              a belief that this was the one relationship that would
              move beyond the threshold of the fury of passion. And that
              we could find a mutuality of priorities and beliefs that
              would supplement and enhance our passions. But alas, time
              dashed this fantasy.</p>
            <p>In all relationships but one, the age difference became
              one of the major factors. Winter/Spring relationships
              seldom weather the day by day realities of life. Are there
              exceptions, of course. That is why I was always optimistic
              that each one could or might be the exception. But in
              reality the odds are stacked against it. The experiential
              gap is to great. When you put one, two or three decades of
              differences between a man and a woman. Along with just the
              day by day adjusting to each others' idiosyncrasies. You
              are asking an awful lot of each party to be able to
              communicate and understand where each&nbsp;is coming from.
              Especially for the one who is trying to catch up in the
              uncharted territory. It is easier for the one who has been
              there but not that easy for someone who is yet to
              experience. You can walk to the door with them, but you
              cannot open it for them. This,they must do&nbsp;on their
              own. But as all married couples come to know. ""No one is
              a prophet in his own country".</p>
            <p>In tow of the relationships there were step-children
              involved. This in itself can be a "can of worms". And a
              bigger one, if the children are entering their adolescence
              and the real father is in the picture. Again, the odds of
              non-adjustment increases. Someone once invited me to
              adjust and become part of the "chaos" at the time; the
              inmates were running the asylum. I declined for reasons of
              sanity and survival. Now if we add to this equation, the
              age difference and the experience factor. Plus a hands off
              approach to child raising as opposed to some order and
              sanity. We will find waiting in the wings, the makings of
              a dysfunctional family. And in this type of situation or
              any situation, it is not a matter as to who is right or
              wrong. Or a matter of who is winning and who is losing. It
              is a question&nbsp;of stability, consistency, priorities
              and direction. And we can throw in balance, peace and
              harmony. If these things are not on the horizon. Are not
              in the game plan. Where is the relationship, or
              relationships?</p>
            <p>Surely it is more than jumping in and out of bed.
              Believing this, will solve all the problems. Sure sex is
              wonderful and exciting and all the superlatives we might
              add. But it is only a fraction of the wealth in a healthy
              relationship. Nor, will problems be solved by having more
              children, or a better job, or more money or any thing we
              might fantasize about. None of these will give us a love
              relationship with a capital "L". Nor a wholeness, or a
              fulfilled meaningful life. Without the core, the
              foundation; the giving of ones-Self to another.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If we skip along on the surface of life. Like skipping
              stones across the pond. Our relationships will continue to
              suffer. Or they will end up in complacency, resignation,
              frustration and a resentment. Usually with a feeling as to
              "what is one to do, things are just the way they are".
              "woe is me"! There has to be some substance within each
              person. Everybody has to bring something to this table, to
              the relationship. That something is themselves, as to
              "who" and "what" they are. Of course the out lying problem
              is that in to many cases; we haven't the foggiest idea of
              "who and what we are, or where we are going"? So how can
              balance, peace and harmony become part of our
              relationships? Our mind, heart and spirit is not in the
              relationship. Our mind, heart and spirit is submerged in a
              thousand and one things, causing us not to be present in
              the present. Awareness is nowhere to be found.</p>
            <p>Let's not linger here anymore.</p>
            <p>Back to an attempt to shed some light on my relationships
              and why? My son in the one and only meeting we had later
              in life. Asked why, I married women much younger than
              myself? I had thought on this long before he asked the
              question. Especially after the first two marriages. The
              year differences within the four marriages were eight,
              fifteen, seven and twenty-two. The marriages lasted;
              seven, eleven, five and five years respectively. One child
              in the first marriage, a baby daughter, we named Michelle;
              who was eighteen months old when the divorce took place.
              In the second marriage there were two children; a boy,
              Mark Lee and a girl named Kerry Lee. The boy was six and
              the girl was a year old, when the second divorce came
              about. No children there after.</p>
            <p>I believe one of the reasons for my marrying women who
              were younger. Was the fact that I always looked younger
              than I was, I still do. Today at seventy-two I am taken to
              be forty-five to fifty years of age. If and that is a big
              if I were to marry again, I would marry someone in there
              forties or late thirties. I am still very active, aware,
              and alive, with a wide range of interests. And the other
              reasons, both the physiological and the psychological, I
              have already spoken about.</p>
            <p>As I have said publicly and privately, I have but few
              regrets. But I have not, nor do I linger there long. The
              decisions that were made pertaining to the divorces were
              not made hastily without thought. The second and third
              divorce changed a career that I had chosen to be my
              life's' work. But it was not to be. All four relationships
              were affected by the age difference; priorities, lifestyle
              differences and how we each saw the World, people and the
              things of the World. We simply wanted different things out
              of life. We&nbsp;approached life differently.</p>
            <p>I am not an advocate that believes that two people should
              stay together because of the children's sake. I have lived
              far to long and seen the ill affects of children being
              raised in a home where the environment was far more
              detrimental and less conducive for the well-being of the
              children. I know there are advocates for the other side.
              An their arguments are persuasive but since I have first
              hand information, out of my own childhood experiences. I
              am persuaded that a dysfunctional family is no family. And
              certainly not the ideal place for raising children. Can
              children carry scars from a divorce scenario. Yes, some
              do. But the healing process and the scar tissue, is also
              affected by the nightmarish ill effects of an ill-fated
              marriage. Where the children unfortunately became
              &nbsp;part of, through no fault of their own. I believe
              that far more children survive and recover from a divorce.
              Than those who live in the most chaotic conditions
              imaginable. Are there irreconcilable conditions in
              marriages? Yes! Can some be mended, Yes! But the mend is
              vulnerable and highly susceptible to further tears in the
              fabric of that marriage. Can all be mended? "No", not at
              this point in time.</p>
            <p>A great majority of the people who profess the reason for
              sticking together is for the children's' sake. Has nothing
              to do with the children. They stay together because of the
              Church, peer and societal pressure. For security reasons,
              job reasons, community property and some for selfish
              reasons, or for reasons only they know. No child should be
              raised in a loveless marriage, a marriage where there is
              utter psychological chaos. Along with a "laissez faire",
              "catch-as-you-catch-can" method of nurturing the child.</p>
            <p>Much is publicized about the divorce rate, the broken
              homes, the single parent homes. As opposed to the merit of
              the many children who live in families, where there is
              both a mother and a father. Which is great! If both the
              mother and father are "Parents" in the truest sense of the
              word. Many are parents who are not parents<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Many are absentee parents. </span></p>
            <p><span>Where both, or one, are seldom there in mind, heart
                and spirit. How many children live in families where
                there is a drunk for a father or a mother? How many
                children live in families where there is sexual and
                psychological abuse? How many children live in families
                where there are physical and verbal beatings on a daily
                or monthly basis? How many children are raised in
                families where they are but indentured slaves? How many
                children live in families where one or both of the
                parents are repeatedly unfaithful, or in the fathers'
                case, has a mistress.? How many children live in
                families where drugs are as common as sliced bread? How
                many children live in families where the parents could
                care less about the who, where, what and why of the
                child's life? How many children live in a family where
                there is no love loss between the parents? How many
                children live in families where there is little or no
                nurturing process taking place? How many children live
                in families where they learn nothing about self-esteem,
                self-respect and self-reliance? Talk to me, about how a
                loveless marriage, a dysfunctional, a chaotic marriage
                should stay together for the children's' sake.</span></p>
            <p>Being part of a family does not necessary mean nor
              guarantee that children will have the most conducive
              conditions for their nourishment, for the growth and
              evolution of their body, mind and spirit. Parents need to
              evaluate and ask; is the present family structure a viable
              vehicle for the care and nurturing of their child? And
              the&nbsp;answer needs to be, "Yes!"</p>
            <p>What promotes and postures this; this happens when the
              parents become aware and realizes they have been given a
              gift. A new born that needs to be nurtured and cared for,
              so that he or she may reach their highest potentialities
              and possibilities. There is no greater challenge than to
              help, to encourage, to motivate, to enhance and to empower
              a child. To be all he or she was created to be.</p>
            <p>All that we have been discussing are A-1 priorities if
              one is to call themselves a parent. One is not a parent
              simply because they are related by blood, genes and
              chromosomes. Or a given mandate by the Court of Law. A
              PARENT is that person or persons who has the best
              interests of the child at heart. And not necessarily the
              parent's interests. Unless those interests happen to be
              for the welfare and care for the child or children at the
              highest level.</p>
            <p>Here is where the values and priorities of the parent
              enter the picture. It is not a matter of what a parent
              thinks or believes to be right and wrong, or what he or
              she believes to be the more excellent for their child's'
              nurturing. We are talking about those things that will
              empower the child, that will create a balance and harmony
              in the child's' life and lay the foundations. So the child
              might learn how to reach their fullest potentialities and
              possibilities. As he/she goes through the various
              developmental learning stages. As he or she moves towards,
              not away from a wholeness and a fulfillment in life. And
              of course we are not talking about the parents doing a
              "Pygmalion" act on their children. As we have repeated so
              often, it is vital for the child's' maturation that they
              learn what it means to have self-esteem and self-respect.
              Along with the art of self-discipline and self-reliance.
              Everyone should be aware that in having a child, does not
              automatically bestow, the name parent. Parent is an earned
              name, not blood given. And holds a far reaching
              responsibility that the parent does everything in their
              power to enhance and engender the growth and evolution of
              their child/children.</p>
            <p>And you ask; What is the most excellent way?</p>
            <p><strong>By actions more than words</strong></p>
            <p>We must never forget that a child, in bodily form is a
              given gift, a cherished gift of vast importance. With far
              reaching potentialities and possibilities . All adults,
              regardless of their race, creeds or religions, have a
              moral responsibility, in helping in the enhancement of the
              wholeness and the fulfillment of all, an any child, if at
              all possible in the course of the day. It might <font
                face="Verdana, Arial">background="../images/backfeet.gif</font>be
              as simple as a small word of encouragement. Or a smile and
              a "hello", "What is your name?"</p>
            <p>Surely, all of us know how important it is to show love
              towards a child. But to smother a child with love and
              affection does more harm than good. It hinders more than
              it helps. But even more than this; children need to be
              taught as well as being loved, in the way they go. And by
              this I do not mean a restrictive hard line discipline. The
              word discipline comes from the word ,"disciple". Which
              means a learner. And that is what a child is about, he is
              natural learner. Inquisitive and curious from the start
              and a great imitator. Which means "more is caught than
              taught" What the parent is or the parents are not. Is what
              the child picks up on. Remember the expressions; "monkey
              see, monkey do." and &nbsp;"little pitchers have big
              ears". It is not so much of that which you speak. As it
              is, in that which you are and do. This is how the child,
              excuse the expression becomes programmed. And for you
              Dewey-ites. Don't get hyper on me. The child is down
              loading all the time. Especially as he watches the adults
              around him. What the young need today are some good role
              models, some honest to goodness "heroes". Where have all
              the heroes gone?</p>
            <p>How I do carry on.</p>
            <p>Let me end this didactic monologue, with the words of a
              song, "Love has been good to me, along the way." What a
              pity so many can only remember the bad times and forget
              those moments of joy and passion. Those warm embraces and
              tender times that made the grass greener, the sky bluer
              and the air fresher. It is differences such as these, that
              become the reason for people to come to the divide in the
              road. Separation is never sudden, usually it is an
              accumulation of many separations along the way that never
              resolve themselves. Or at the very beginning, when love
              becomes buried beneath the ashes of a fiery passion that
              consumes, any and all differences.</p>
            <p>Can you remember, dancing after the music stopped? If
              only this could be true in marriages. Where the music has
              already stopped.</p>
            <p><b>A Postscript:</b></p>
            <p>I purposely did not answer the question; "Am I lonely? Do
              I feel lonely?" I have partially answered this in the
              "Question and Answers" article, elsewhere on <font
                face="Verdana, Arial">background="../images/backfeet.gif</font>the
              site. Let me repeat, there is a vast difference between
              loneliness and aloneness. Both loneliness and aloneness
              are conditioned by a particular posturing, brought about
              by many influences that set the stage for a particular
              posture to take place. If we can learn to become aware of
              the influences that bring on the state of "loneliness", as
              to how it structures itself and further perpetuates
              itself. Then we have a possibility to move towards a state
              of "aloneness". And I would quickly add that this is not a
              static state. Aloneness is a freedom, a flowing freedom
              from attachments. Those attachments that limit and bind
              one to that, or those subtle influences and conditioning
              that captures and envelops ones mind, heart and spirit.</p>
            <p>The companion word of aloneness, is solitude. Both
              aloneness and solitude are not to be misconstrued as a
              form of isolation. On the contrary, they affirm, and allow
              a unity with" all and everything". The isolation of a
              person is self-induced, as an out growth of anxieties,
              fear, worry, and misgiving about oneself. The
              psychological imbalanced or inharmonious person isolates
              themselves. They build their own wall around themselves,
              shutting out the world, as it is. While at the same time
              creating their own fantasy world, in which they live. As
              we have said repeatedly; they create and structure their
              own reality. Much the same way, that people create their
              god, in their own image. Out of their fragmented thinking.
              Let's put a comma here.</p>
            <p>Later, we will talk more about this aloneness and
              solitude. In connection with meditation and insight.</p>
