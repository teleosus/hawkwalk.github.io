                style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;">Can one occupy two
                places at the same time? Can one be above and below,
                here and there, in the "Now"?&nbsp;It has been
                said&nbsp;that the "Past" and the "Future" are joined in
                the "Now". If the "Now" is the crossover, an interfacing
                between the past and the future. Does this mean there is
                "no time" at that precise moment? That " time and space"
                have become neutralized, a "Void"; like a center of an
                axle that does not move while the axle is spinning. Does
                the saying; "You are in the world, but you are not of
                it; "mean the "of and in",{ the "there and here"}
                co-exist side by side in the "Now", merging into one".
                Allowing us at that precise moment to see the "real and
                the unreal" as one.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Possibly, the
                veil is parted just for a "nanosecond". As we "see" the
                "Void". And know, "Who" we are, who we have always been
                and will always be. One with "All and Everything", Our
                will&nbsp;and The "Will" are One". The spiral has been
                completed. The "Return" is finalized. Devolution and
                Evolution served their purposes. The blind see the deaf
                hear, the sick are healed. All are "Holy" {Whole} once
                again.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">"You are in
                the world but not of it". Also infers that we are
                independent of the World. Here, I guess one needs to
                ask, what "World" are we talking about? I must confess
                that my World is probably not your World or vice versa.
                Someone once asked me, while speaking to a group; "How
                many worlds are there"? My reply without thought was:
                "About as many worlds as there are people".&nbsp;In most
                cases, we create our own worlds. Those worlds, where we
                spend the most time in. Then there are those worlds; we
                allow others to create for us. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Come to think
                of it, the "actual" World {Natural World} is just fine.
                It is "our worlds", those we create for ourselves that
                are so sadly in need of repair. In other words, we need
                to heal ourselves before we start fixing the "World",
                people and the things of the World. As they do
                say;&nbsp;"Physician heal thyself".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">In light of
                the above, we could say, "that the World is in each of
                us". Because of our predisposition to make the "World"
                in our image, or as we see it. One of the reasons for
                this fragmentary reasoning, has its' roots in our
                susceptibility to be "asleep", "metaphorically"
                speaking, instead of being "awake". The song: "Row, row,
                your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, life
                is but a dream", is close to the mark. For is it not
                true, we spent a tremendous amount of time, walking
                around "asleep or dreaming", rather than being fully
                "awake" to our potentialities and
                possibilities.&nbsp;Even more so, as to "who we are" and
                "why we are here". How often have we heard or read, that
                we need to "awaken". So we can become "alive" and "aware
                of life and all it has to offer. It is to bad that some,
                that many are just walking around to save funeral
                expenses.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">How can this
                be?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">The culprit is
                our tendency to accept, to believe that what we see,
                what we structure, is Reality. This we know is not
                always so. For the most part, we live, no we exist in a
                two dimensional, transient World. With an occasional
                glimpse, or a "sense" of a third dimension. Better
                still, we have a feeling that, there is something more.
                In answer to: "Is this all there is"?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Listen to
                these few lines from antiquity:</span></p>
            <div><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Something
                there is<br>
                Whose veiled creation was?<br>
                Before the earth or sky began,<br>
                So silent, so aloof and so alone.<br>
                It changes not, nor fails, but touches all<br>
                Is there a name?<br>
                A name for it, is "Way"<br>
                The way conforms to its own nature.</span></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><span style="font-family: Verdana;;">Author Unknown}</span></div>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">This
                "Something which just is" has also been called the
                "Witness", the "Observer", or&nbsp;the "Watcher",
                {'something' inside looking out}. In the horizontal
                dimension, this" Witness" was asleep, not conscious of
                itself. But in&nbsp;the vertical dimension this
                "Observer" was dreaming, still not aware of itself. In
                the third dimension, the "waking state" begins. Moving
                from the thinking, to the feeling, to the instinctual {A
                knowing}. The "Watcher" awakens and has the ability to
                perceive both the "subject and the object" without
                identifying with either one. He is aware of them both.
                This "awareness" is called depth. Now we have the visual
                perception of the horizontal, vertical and depth. Moving
                us from a surface perception, to the "above and below".
                Because of this, we are "aware" of things moving through
                space. The sense of depth&nbsp;comes into play.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Too often
                "surface people" take the waves and the ripples to be
                the sea. With little thought that the surface can only
                offer a partial reality. Therefore, if one has the
                desire and the determination to "Know". One needs to go
                "inward", delve into the silent depths, where the
                "Observer" lives. What is this "Source" of Life? It has
                been called many things. One could humanize it and call
                it the "Mind of God". But whatever term we use, it is
                inadequate. As someone once said; "Our God is too
                small". If one must use the word "God", then they must
                think "Big", really "Big".&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">This is also
                true when one "awakens", there is more, than what meets
                the eye. This&nbsp; also applies; that people are much
                more than they believe themselves to be. They can, if
                they so choose, "to become and be" fully actualized,
                becoming and being all that they were created to "Be".
                Who they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really
                  are </span>but have forgotten who they really are and
                have always been.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">If we accept
                ourselves and others as we are, in the ordinary sense of
                the word. Then we are doing great damage to ourselves,
                others and the World at large. But if we will accept
                ourselves and others as being intrinsically the
                "expressed Image" of the "Supreme Absolute". Then
                there&nbsp;is no "separateness'. I am he/her and she/he
                is me.&nbsp;I will&nbsp;see all their hidden
                possibilities and potentialities. All that, which they
                can "become and be". In simple language; they are that
                already, but not knowing it. We are "family", we come
                from the same "Seed" {Substance], of "Absolute Love".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">You ask; what
                is this thing called love? To repeat;" Before we can
                love others, we must first learn to love ourselves
                {"Love others as you love yourself"}. But how can we
                love ourselves, when we do not know or understand who we
                are? </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">When we come
                to know that our "True Nature" is to become and be, what
                we have always been; the "expressed image". Hand in hand
                with this en-light-enment comes the "knowing" that
                everyone, regardless of creed, dogma, and belief; has
                this same "True Nature" as the " old gospel song" says;
                "we are all Gods' children". That is what, they do say.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">So what is
                love, we ask again? What is behind the words; "love
                others as you love yourself". If we love ourselves, we
                want the best, the more excellent for ourselves. Right!
                even if we do not understand what is best and the more
                excellent. But when we finally "Know", that is what we
                want. More than we want anything else on earth. All
                systems go! </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">So how do we
                love others, regardless of who they think themselves to
                be? By realizing. that we are of the same "substance",
                the same spiritual gene {metaphorically speaking}. We
                want the best, the more excellent for them. We want them
                to know, to be "aware" as to "who" they really are. Not
                who they think they are.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">How do we do
                this? That is the question that all beliefs have been
                asking since the beginning of time.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">The one tried
                and true method, if it can be called a method, is
                "role-modeling". To "become and be" the abstract
                thought, the concept, the belief, giving it your "flesh
                and blood ". The "Incarnation"{Love becoming flesh}. In
                other words; "walk the talk'. This cannot be bequeathed
                or come second hand. Until one becomes the embodiment of
                the said word, then and only then. The truth appears
                unannounced. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Enough can
                never be said about the use of words to explain the
                unexplainable. So we repeat, silence is probably the
                best defined, the best source of enlightenment. For deep
                within, the "Inner Guide" is waiting for the right
                question, to give the right answer. So seek within, but
                we have heard these words before, along with; "Know
                thyself" and the "Kingdom of God is within". Or maybe
                the question should be; "have we heard these words"? For
                if we "hear", we do.</span></p>
            If we hear correctly, we become and be. For in "being", the
            next step is doing.
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Do what? Those
                necessary things that will create the environment that
                will sustain ones' well-ness of being: mentally,
                physically and spiritually. And not do those unnecessary
                things that hinder and impoverish the spirit and the art
                of living. For a seed to grow, the ground must be
                cultivated, making sure that the soil has the proper
                nutrients to assure that the plant or the tree will
                reach fruition. Unsavory conditions produce unsavory
                crops.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Part of this
                cultivation is to grab a hold of "Life", with both hands
                and let it teach you how to live and die, to die and
                live. To die to that which binds and steals our freedom.
                To that which limits our possibilities and
                potentialities. Out of these daily deaths and their
                ashes, life bursts upon the scene, anew. And we begin to
                see and realize that we "have been given everything we
                need, we but need to experience every we have been
                given". Reality is as close to you and me as our
                breaths.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Reality is not
                a means to an end. It is not a process, a method,
                something in flux. It is an end unto itself. It is
                independent, uncaused, unquestionable, indescribable and
                unrelated. It just IS. It is the 'All in the All of
                Everything'. Reality is not part of the past or the
                future. It is the moment, the "Now". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">We need to let
                the "dead bury the dead". To walk around in the "grave
                clothes" of yesterday is not fashionable, it is
                pathetic. What kind of myths and superstitions are we
                holding onto, out of our pasts? How many blanks and gaps
                exist in our memory responses as to how it was or
                wasn't? How many illusions do we have, which we have
                allowed others to program for us? We need to examine our
                excess baggage and lighten our load. We are suffering
                from an "overload", making&nbsp;our "NOW's"&nbsp;pale
                and anemic looking.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">We create our
                temporary worlds with a collection of fragmented "memory
                responses" bits and pieces of our imaginings,
                expectations, illusions, anticipation's, and sense
                deprivations. We look but we do not see. We listen but
                we do not hear. We think, but we are not aware. We do,
                but the {Self} is not there. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">We complain
                about the "fragmented state of the World" with all its'
                problems. About the inequities, the violence, the lack
                of moral fibre, civility and the widening gap between
                those who have and those who do not have, The "World is
                fragmented and divided, because the "World "mirrors us.
                It mirrors our confusion our disorder, our selfishness
                and our "separateness". Because we are separated from
                ourselves. We do not know "who" or "what" we are, or
                "why" or "where" we are going? "We are like the pilot
                who radio the air controllers and told them. That he was
                lost. But that he was making good time".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">So. What to
                do? Well in the words of today's' technology. Delete,
                delete and&nbsp;"reprogram","reprogram".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">How?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">"Know
                Thyself"!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">We need to
                gain a self-knowledge and a self-understanding as to who
                we are, really are. And ask ourselves, where am I going?
                And how do I get there? What is necessary, what is
                unnecessary? This is where the reprogramming begins. As
                someone once said; "we can choose to grow weeds or
                flowers in our gardens". What will it be?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">Every thought
                we allow into our minds, every word we allow our lips to
                utter, every action we choose is of our own doing. If
                our life is in shambles. If we are not doing so well,
                pretty good, mentally, physically and spiritually. We
                need to look in the mirror and say to ourselves; 'SURELY
                THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS"? Maybe it is time that
                we took a hold of our lives and stop complaining,
                blaming and "singing the blues". And repeat as many
                times that it takes:</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial;;">This is my
                life and I am going to do something with it, "NOW"!</span></p>
