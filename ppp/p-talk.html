            <p>A recent <strong>"Hawktalk"</strong> at a University.</p>
            <p><strong>"Walk the Talk" and "Talk The Walk"</strong></p>
            <p>In the year 2012, give or take a year or two. There will
              appear on the bookshelves of the World, a new book. Whose
              pages and details are being written as we speak.</p>
            <p>It will be a story about a seven year old boy and his
              dream. The year is 1935 during those years just after the
              "Great Depression" in America. A boyhood dream about
              someday; walking around the World. Not in "eighty days" as
              the famous Jules Verne wrote about in his novel. But a
              walk around the World in 7,000 plus days or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>As this young boy was growing up on a small farm in
              middle America, there was a popular love song being played
              on the radio. With the lyrics asking a very curious
              question. " Have you ever seen a dream walking; well I
              have."</p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">So have I; for
                you see I am that boy and his dream of seventy-two years
                ago. Who at this point in time and space has completed
                seventeen years of a twenty-one or twenty-two year
                odyssey around the World. Which has covered
                approximately 80,000 miles. Fourteen thousand of those
                miles was in walking the "Fifty-States" of America. </span><span
                style="font-family: Verdana;">Which had never been done
                before</span></p>
            <p>Walt Whitman in a poem entitled, "A Song Of The Open
              Road" wrote these words; " I am in step with my vision. As
              I tramp my perpetual journey." To paraphrase; "I am in
              step with my dream as I walk ' the Path less traveled.'</p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As I thought
                about the words, I might offer up during our brief
                encounter. And how if fortunate enough, they might come
                "alive" in your respective lives. Three little words
                kept re-entering my thought streams. Three very
                important words; no, not " I love you" as important as
                these words are; especially to our loved ones. Which we
                do not possibly express as often as we should. But the
                three words I had in mind for you to hear and to think
                on, are;</span></p>
            <p><strong>"Walk the Talk"</strong></p>
            <p>By this we simply mean: be that which you speak, speak
              that which you are. The words of my grandfather are still
              with me. As he spoke to my father one day:" A mans' word
              is his bond, a binding commitment, an obligation to the
              word one speaks."Someone once wrote, Emerson I believe;"
              What you are, speaks so loudly. I cannot hear what you are
              saying."</p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">If the truth
                was known; we teach and communicate more by being and
                doing than by a mere avalanche of words. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We catch the
                spirit, the aliveness, the energy and excitement of the
                moment and the one who is&nbsp;speaking."<strong> More
                  is caught than taught</strong>". It is the intensity
                and energy, along with the impact and the aliveness of
                the word spoken that persuades, cajoles and convinces
                the hearer. The spoken word , what a responsibility.
                What a responsibility indeed!</span></p>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">How we speak,
              what we say or don't say. What a challenge! Especially in
              today's' knowledge and information explosion which is
              accelerating and will continue to do so, at even a far
              greater rate as we pass on through the Twenty-First
              Century into the Twenty-Second Century. But regardless of
              how fast or how much information is being transferred up
              and down the information highway. We must keep in
              perspective that the High Tech."Communication" machinery
              is a tool for all humankind. We do not serve the machine,
              the machine serves us. Therefore we still have the
              responsibility in the choosing of the words and how we
              re-present them.</span>
            <p>We do not have the time in this moment to speak about the
              Art of Communication in its' totality.(the various nuances
              that are involved, as well as all the needed skills and
              technique which are 'part and parcel' in the media
              disciplines of today.) Instead, let me offer a brief
              definition that proposes a different insight for
              communicating.</p>
            <p>To communicate, one must be in communion with oneself and
              others which recalls two time honoured mandates or if you
              prefer two proven affirmations out of the past. The first
              one; which has been attributed to Socrates: "Know thyself"
              and the second one; "And unto thy own self be true." by
              Marcus Aurelius. If we can somehow learn the secret that
              is offered by these two pearls of wisdom and incarnate
              them within. Making them part of our flesh and blood;
              a&nbsp; true driving force in our daily living, our daily
              thinking and doing. Not only will we be the better for it
              as we come to understand ourselves and others. We will be
              better equipped to communicate in all areas and levels of
              social discourse and be understood.</p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">When this
                happens, it is important to remember the following.
                "Every thing that has a beginning, has an ending." And
                secondly, "This too shall pass." So do not give up.
                Communication has to be worked at.</span></p>
            <p>True Communication is in the giving, the offering up of
              information, knowledge, wisdom, values, et.cetera. But
              even deeper, it is the offering up of one's self, the
              giving of one's self, the breathings of one's self. The
              giving of who and what one is. One's is-ness, their
              uniqueness, as he or she understands it to be. And of
              course here comes the "rub". At the very bottom of our
              poor relationships and our inability to understand
              ourselves and others is the glaring fact, the truth. We do
              not know who and what we are? We have never taken the time
              to honestly and sincerely ask ourselves; <strong>"Who am
                I? Why am I here? And where am I going?"</strong></p>
            <p>Which brings us back to "Know thyself". The very
              foundation of communication. You must Be, be that which
              you speak.</p>
            <p><strong>"Walk the Talk"</strong></p>
            <p>If you and I are going to grow, to evolve within our
              various enterprises. We must create by thought, word and
              deed the most conducive conditions, so that all men, women
              and children may grow and evolve to their highest
              possibilities and potentialities.</p>
            <p>In light of this; you and I need to search out those
              ways, means and instruments that will help promote,
              motivate, enthuse, engender, energize, enhance, affirm and
              celebrate those possibilities of becoming all we were
              meant to be and can be.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest of all truths; is that we are
              already, already "THAT!" But we have somehow misplaced
              ourselves forgetting who we really are. Sort of a
              selective amnesia. But have we really forgotten. Ever once
              in awhile we hear; "I'm not myself today." Or "I am beside
              myself." It is hard to imagine that we could forget such a
              'Gift? 'To err is human', they do say! But it is also
              said; "we are more divine than human."</p>
            <p>So the reality is;&nbsp;our lives can be the 'color of
              joy and the sound of music.' Now some may ask: if this is
              possible? And I would quickly add, Yes! Yes! Why? Because
              we have every thing we need. We but need to experience
              everything we have been given.</p>
            <p>One of the underlying dilemmas of the human situation has
              to do with our priority lists of needs. We have allowed
              our needs to be infiltrated by our wants.&nbsp;"Wants" are
              "horses of a different color". Needs are essential to our
              survival to our well-being. Whereas our wants are more
              self-indulging, self-serving and less essential. Of course
              our wants have a greater PR.(public relations) going for
              them. If you buy this, possess this, get this, you will
              be..... You fill in the blank.</p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The 'Hallmark'
                choice, is that choice which is the 'best,
                the&nbsp;better and the more excellent' for us. It
                should not have to be said: but we need to choose well
                both in thought word and deed as to the far reaching
                consequences, not only for "the now" but also for the
                future. Because our choices affect not only our lives
                but the lives of others.</span></p>
            <p>Life is not just a matter of thinking or feeling and
              above all, not just existing. Life is about being aware,
              on a breath to breath basis.&nbsp;Also in the aliveness of
              becoming, of being the very best which life is constantly
              offering up to us on a day to day agenda. Is it not sad
              that so many are just walking around to save funeral
              expenses. They are dead and guess, what?, they don't know
              it.</p>
            <p>Back to our original statement. I bet you thought I had
              forgotten. "<strong>Walk the Talk</strong>", be that which
              you speak. Let's reduce these words down to a practical
              application. Case in point; if you and I want to have a
              friend, what must you and I do? I hope your answer was: in
              thought, word and deed. We must be a friend first. Would
              you agree? Yes! If we want to be loved, we must become
              love, be love. And this process of becoming holds true for
              any value, wisdom or whatever it is that we seek after; be
              it truth, beauty or goodness. In other words; you and I
              must "<strong>Walk The Talk</strong>".</p>
            <p>It wouldn't be a bad idea if we would ask ourselves
              before we speak to our loved ones, friends, associates and
              yes, even the stranger. If we are that which we are about
              to utter?</p>
            <p>Be that which you speak, easy "No" <br>
              worthwhile, yes! <br>
              do-able, yes! <br>
              You see 'Will Shakespeare' was right. <br>
              "To be or not to be that is the question."</p>
            <p>So is your choice "<strong>to be or not to be</strong>?"</p>
            <div>What's it going to be? Are you going to "<strong>Walk
                the Talk and Talk the Walk?</strong>"</div>
            <p>It would be nice!</p>
