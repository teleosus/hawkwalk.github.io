            <p>Fishing in every state in America including; British
              Columbia, Alaska, the Yukon and Hawaii. For my breakfast
              and dinner at times.</p>
            <p>Reliving those roaring, "hell bent" days of those early
              miners that came from all over the world in the late 18th.
              Century. Looking for "Yukon gold." As they stood at the
              beginning of the "Chilkoot Trail". To make the climb for
              "fame and fortune" As I looked down as I topped the rim of
              the mountain, I could almost see the long line, of those
              thousands of men that challenged "The Chilkcoot" and its'
              elements. As they looked to the top and beyond to their
              dreams and hopes for the future.</p>
            <p>Panning for platinum gold. Moving tons of dirt through a
              sluice box in the Dawson area of the Yukon, up beyond
              Alaska. For only a few precious ounces of "yellow". Then
              they would make &nbsp;their way down to Dawson City. And
              spend it all&nbsp;at "Dirty Gertys'" Gambling Emporium. As
              they watched the "can, can" girls do their thing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Walking through time while descending down through the
              walls of Grand Canyon, above the Colorado River.</p>
            <p>Capturing the sunrise in the lens of my camera, as it
              played hid and seek amid the monolithic rock giants that
              rise above&nbsp;the floor of Monument Valley National
              Park, in Arizona.</p>
            <p>Competing in a tomahawk and knife throwing contest with
              some Native Americans on the Reservation, in Arizona</p>
            <p>&nbsp;All the sights and sounds and the smells of the
              many marketplaces, fairs and Casaba's around the world.</p>
            <p>Pitching my tent in the middle of the Serengeti Plain or
              the Riff Valley. Or along the banks of the Zambezi River
              where Dr.Livington might have camped. I have walked,
              camped and cooked all over the World. There is nothing
              that compares {well, maybe something} with the sense of
              freedom that one feels upon awakening amid the sounds of
              the natural world. I am sure that Thoreau must have felt
              the same thing at "Walden Pond" as he awakened each
              morning to the freshness and innocence of the day.</p>
            <p>The game trails and paths; two days with the Massai
              people shortly after crossing over into Kenya from
              Ethiopia. In and out of the back door of many of the Game
              Reserves. Feeling the thrill of the challenge, as I
              approached Mt. Kenya's and Hemingway's' beloved
              Kilimanjaro' peaks. As a boy;I had read of&nbsp;his
              experiences and adventurers&nbsp;during his time of
              climbing this jewel of Africa.</p>
            <p>What&nbsp;a thrill to finally be standing at the foot of
              each of these mountains. And accept the challenge of
              the&nbsp;climb.&nbsp;Words fail to portray&nbsp;the beauty
              and&nbsp;grandeur&nbsp;of these&nbsp;two timeless gifts.</p>
            <p>When one becomes a part of and feels the presence, the
              energy of the climb, the alive-sens of the moment. One
              becomes aware that each and everything" above and below"
              are but&nbsp;one.&nbsp;We are connected, we are "family".I
              am convinced that this aware-sens can happen anywhere,
              anytime. The time is not predictable. "Silence and
              attention" are vital for this to happen. "Be still and
              know, " This is the call."</p>
            <p>All the "oohs, ah Ha's, and wows"! Of&nbsp;this big Wide
              Wonderful World, we have inherited is&nbsp;beyond words.
              Our shame is; that we seldom give any thanks for the
              abundance.</p>
            <p>All the architectural and natural monuments of "man" and
              nature. The Great Pyramids rising out of the sands of
              Egypt. The "Leaning Tower" of Pisa. The Acropolis,
              Stonehenge, Notre Dame, along with St. Peters in Rome.
              Monument Valley and Grand Canyon and the list goes on..</p>
            <p>The scattered reminders of the pomp, power and ceremony
              of our past, as represented in the thousands of Castles,
              Museums and Art Galleries spread throughout the Countries
              of the World</p>
            <p>I have been privy to see and experience the various
              ethnicities, cultures, customs and traditions&nbsp;of the
              world. &nbsp;And felt the wide spread
              generosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The willingness of people, of all
              sizes and shapes, creeds and colors, giving to a total
              stranger {Food and shelter}. But even more important, a
              feeling and seeing their concern and friendship. Their
              smiles and laughter. Even in the midst of the most
              adverse, heart rendering conditions of scarcity and
              hardship. One could ever imagine.</p>
            <p>All the visual sights of Nature. With her hues and colors
              that would cause an artists' palette to blush. And
              tongue-tie the most gifted of poet</p>
            <p><span>The rolling hills, the thundering waters that
                cascade over rocks, rushing headlong down the
                mountainside. To become part of "all and everything".
                The beauty and peace of the worlds' forests with her
                thousands, upon thousands of tree lined sentinels,
                standing in silence, watching over Natures' Kingdom.</span></p>
            <p>Those breathless sunrises over the rise of a distant
              mountain or on the crest of a shimmering wave.&nbsp;All
              the sunsets that take, ones' breath away. Those of the
              postcard variety.</p>
            <p>The bursts of spring that sing of life and love. The
              thaws of the worlds' winterlands.<br>
              That have that fairy book look.</p>
            <p>The fusion's of flowers that carpet the interiors of the
              World, with their dazzling fashion of colors. That swing
              and sway at the slightest hint of a breeze. Wither they be
              along the boulevards of Milan, Paris or London. Or in the
              flower boxes and fields of Holland, Russia or Spain</p>
            <p>The deadly silence of both sea and ocean or the constant
              babble of a running brook; that plays among the rocks.
              Then, you have the running rivers. Some quick, fast, and
              dangerous with their hidden rocks and the killer jaws of
              submerged Crocks and Hippos.</p>
            <p>All the animals in their native habitat, where "survival
              of the fittest" is the name of the game. Where beauty,
              grace and speed is on a grand scale. While the animals do
              those things; they are best at, be they big or small. Of
              land, air or water.</p>
            <p>And the deserts of the world, that have a surreal beauty,
              all their own. As one watches the light and shadows,
              dancing in and out of the shifting sands. As&nbsp;the mind
              begins to fill with images of the endless lines of man and
              beasts, who at one time traveled the famous "Silk Trade"
              routes of yesteryear. With their fine silks and spices for
              a price.</p>
            <p>As the light begins to slowly fade; the surrealistic
              beauty of the day is replaced by the resplendent beauty of
              the night. A night that has a thousand eyes, that holds
              you in their gaze. Until "Morpheus" the prince of the
              night arrives, and you ask; "please hold back the dawn,
              let the night with her beauty, stay with me; a little
              while longer. "Just a little while longer."</p>
            <p>On the "I-Max." screen of the World, there is so much to
              see, to become part of and it of us. That one needs at
              least a hundred lives or so.&nbsp;Since this is not
              possible at the present. We should not miss, even the
              tinniest of moments to see all we possibly can. What is
              that saying; "We past by this world but once''&nbsp;so we
              need to soak in all we can, before our bodies dry up and
              blow away. &nbsp;I am &nbsp;often asked; do I ever get
              lonely walking the World? &nbsp;How could this be
              possible, when just around the corner or over the next
              horizon. &nbsp;Or down a lane or a city street there could
              be "the sight", the wonder; the experience of a lifetime.
              Just waiting for me to come along. When you think about
              it, how lucky can a fellow be?</p>
            <p>Well, here comes my signature.</p>
            <p>Do you happen to have a dream tucked away somewhere, a
              dream, to be or do? If you have, don't ever lose it. Hold
              on to it! Take it out and dust it off, now and then! Maybe
              that very "now": may be the right "now". To just do it.
              &nbsp;For, the final reality of any dream is, just do it!</p>
            <p>Happy days and happy trails!.</p>
