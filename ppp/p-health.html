            <p><b>A Little Background</b> (drum roll if you please!)</p>
            <p>In February of 2010 while I was in Leon, Nicaragua I
              decided to leave Nicaragua and&nbsp; head for Mexico. One
              morning "I had a hitch in my giddy-up"&nbsp;I was having a
              difficult time walking. Plus my balance&nbsp;was off. I
              decided to temporarily interrupt my walk and head directly
              to a VA. Hospital, stateside.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This happened once before. I was in Xian, China. I had to
              go on crutches, my back went out. I checked into a Army
              Hospital.</p>
            <p>The Chinese doctor that was doing the examining had done
              his internship at the "Mayo Clinic" in, New York. Now he
              was the head surgeon of the Osteopathic Department. He
              suggested that the ruptured disk that showed up on the
              MRI, could be repaired via surgery to relieve the pain.
              That remedy did not particularly excite me, I ask if there
              was another approach to the problem. He went on to say;
              that there was a number of back and abdominal exercises
              that might strengthen the basic core muscles which could
              possibly revive the pain. I replied, "that's for me".</p>
            <p>I started the given exercises along with 'pumping some
              iron'. After a month I was walking and playing tennis
              again. "How sweet it was!"! Now and then, in the following
              months I would have muscle spasms upon awaking and a
              little uneasiness in my lower back. But I would just walk
              through it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I checked into the VA Hospital in Houston,Texas&nbsp;on
              March the third, 2010.</p>
            <p>I became a living pin cushion after many blood tests.
              Following all the blood tests, the x-rays, the MRI came
              the evaluation from my Provider Physician who collected
              all the reviews and comments about my physical condition.</p>
            <p>My Prostate growth level had moved from a 4.2 level to a
              7.66 level.</p>
            <p>I was informed that if one was past the age of 75, a
              biopsy would not be done unless the patient insisted that
              it be done. And also, since I was 82 years of age there
              was a strong indication that I had prostate cancer and
              that an operation due to my age would be risky at best.
              The physician went on to say: that the older I would get
              the growth would be slower. And that I would probably not
              die of cancer but of old age. I thought to myself; "how
              nice "!</p>
            <p>Now, as for my back problems: The MRI said that I
              have&nbsp;Osteoarthritis, Spondylitis and Stenosis up and
              down my spine. Six of my spinal disks were bulging at the
              seams. From the Lumbar area; up to the Cervical disks.
              Stenosis had set in causing the canal that surrounds my
              spinal cord to narrow. In turn the spinal nerves were
              being affected. I have little or no feeling in the lower
              part of my legs and feet. The doctor remarked; "I do not
              know how you are able to walk. But somehow you are". As to
              how long it will be that you will be able to walk is
              anybody's' guess." He went on to say: "that if I gave in
              to my present&nbsp;condition. I would become bed ridden
              much faster. So keep moving."</p>
            <p>I left Houston and returned to Mexico to finish the walk.</p>
            <p>Presently, I am on three drugs for the rest of my life,
              unless the heavens split open an a miracle happens. Two
              are for the prostate and the third is to help relieve the
              very annoying pain in my back, etc,,,A NEW NAME HAS BEEN
              ADDED TO MY CHARTS : Neuropathy ( no feeling in my ankles
              and feet).</p>
            <p>As they do say;" Into each life some rain will fall and
              that's life". I remarked to the physician; that all my
              life I have been blessed with unbelievable 'good health'
              and in the light of what I have seen not only in all the
              World but especially since being in a Veterans' Hospital
              and seeing the physical handicaps of so many. I am indeed
              fortunate.</p>
            <p>I would suggest for all those who are feeling sorry for
              themselves. Please visit a Veterans' or a Children's ward
              and see the incurables. Enough said.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Postscript</b><br>
              <br>
              Upon hearing the words: " You will probably not die from
              cancer but of old age." I thought to myself; 'I am
              standing in the middle of 'old'. What a rude awakening!
              But the real blessing is; I'm the lucky one, I have
              reached the golden years. So many have not</p>
            <p><b>Remember every ending holds within a new beginning.
                The marriage of these two can connect all the dots.</b><br>
              <br>
              Life is a 'walk' down many unknown roads. Some smooth
              others a little bumpy. A few are&nbsp;under construction
              with detour signs ahead. If we are fortunate enough, we
              will walk many roads leading to many destinations.
              Learning along the way that the journey in most cases is
              more important than the destinations. &nbsp;Just maybe
              there will be a very long road&nbsp;winding its' way
              homeward bound. And we will arrive warm and well in the
              winter months of our lives.&nbsp;Hopefully looking forward
              to the wonders of a new spring, a new beginning, a new
              journey.</p>
            <p><span><b>New Health Alert&nbsp;</b></span></p>
            <p>I am slowly getting my balance back via Physical Therapy,
              Water Exercises and walking a mile every day. My&nbsp;<span>challenge

                is to ride a bicycle before the summer is over when
                balance improves. Then on to "TaiChi". Once I feel sure
                that my balance is completely back. My next challenge is
                to get back on a Honda Aspencade motorcycle. Then back
                to playing tennis.</span></p>
            <p><span>Next month I will be 86 years young. My biggest
                challenge is reaching the Gold Medal, ( 100 years )
                young or over. I have lived by Challenges all my life.
                Maybe; this will be my last. Maybe not!</span></p>
