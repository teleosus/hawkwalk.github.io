          <td valign="top" align="left"><span style="font-family:
              Verdana, Arial;">The year 1935, America was recovering
              from the throes of the <em>Great Depression</em> that had
              decimated the country. Leaving in its' wake; shattered
              dreams and hopes, along with many lives. The <em>land of
                the plenty</em> had been staggered and floored, but it
              picked itself up, dusted itself off and got back in the
              race. Rolled up it's sleeves and put its' shoulder to the
              proverbial wheel once more. "Down but not out" was the
              shout and the holler throughout the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;A day
              never to be forgotten; during that same year was
              on&nbsp;August the twenty eighth, the day of my eighth
              birthday.&nbsp;I remember on the evening of that day
              accompanying my Mother and her new husband to a Movie
              theater located on the Circle called the<em> "Lyric"</em>
              theater in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana.</span>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In the
                "Thirties", there were a number of theaters, booking a
                wide assortment of stage entertainment which included
                many Vaudevillian acts; known Dance Bands of the late
                "Twenties and Thirties, Dance reviews, a few Musicals
                and of course a little Burlesque thrown in. All which
                helped heal the wounded American psyche during the
                aftermath of the financial disaster that had left its'
                mark on the American society. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">On this
                special night of special nights, we attended the theater
                which was part of the Keith Circuit. The marquee outside
                read; "My Little Chick-a-dee" starring<em>&nbsp;
                  "W.C.Fields and Mae West",</em> the "Blonde Bombshell"<em>.</em>&nbsp;With


                a&nbsp;Stage Presentation to follow the Movie, the
                renowned Dance Band of "Ted Lewis". Along with a few
                additional acts; a Comedian, Acrobatic jugglers and a
                Dance review. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">After the
                Movie had finished there was a brief intermission before
                the beginning of the Stage Presentation. The Curtain
                bell finally rang and the ticket holders hurried back to
                their seats. The house lights dimmed and the spotlights
                turned center stage. As the curtains parted; the Ted
                Lewis band played their theme song; <strong>When My
                  Baby Smiles At Me</strong>. The leader of the band,
                Mr.Ted Lewis, with his battered top-hat in one hand and
                his licorice stick (a clarinet, to the uninitiated) in
                the other hand, stepped in front of his band and
                shouted, "Is Everybody Happy?" The crowd replied as
                though they were in Church with a faint questionable
                "Yes". Mr. Lewis once again shouted; "Is Everybody.."
                and before the word "happy" could clear his lips, I
                leaped to my feet and shouted at the top of my voice;
                "Yes."(as Mother tried to dissolved into her seat.) </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Mr. Lewis
                laughed and said; "At least somebody is excited about
                being happy. Will someone please escort that young man
                up to the stage." When I reached the stage, Mr. Lewis
                extended his hand, as the spotlights danced around about
                me. And Mr. Lewis asked, "And what is your name young
                man? And could you tell us, why, you are so happy?"
                After giving my name, I said, "Mr. Lewis, it is my
                eighth birthday."The Band struck up <em>Happy Birthday</em>,
                and they and the crowd sang. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As I returned
                to my seat, the spotlight followed me as the crowd
                clapped. I was on cloud nine or possibly ten. Once again
                Mr. Lewis' words resounded; "Is Everybody Happy?" In
                unison; the entire audience shouted a convincing "yes!"
                By this time my parents had resumed an upright position
                in their seats. What a night what a Birthday present! I
                was sure there wasn't a happier boy in all of Indiana
                that night. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Which brings
                us to ask; What is this thing called "happiness?" Why is
                it that so many are not happy? Why is it that happiness
                is so fleeting, so temporary for some? Happiness, where
                does it come from? The answer to Mr. Lewis' perennial
                stage question, "Is everybody happy?" seems to attract
                more "nays."than "yays", and we ask, why? </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">What kind of
                Happiness are we talking about, anyway? </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Well, we are
                not talking about a grin from ear to ear. Or a an
                accredited "Dale Carnegie" type smile, as practiced by
                "Smiling Jack "the friendly used car salesman. Or the
                frozen smile of a Miss Universe contestant. Nor the
                obsequious pontifical smile that pretends to be "the
                milk of human kindness." Or a look-alike Mother Teresa's
                smile without the inner light. All the above are a far
                cry from this thing called "happiness". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The happiness
                we are proposing is an attempt to address the problem of
                consistency and permanence as it is related to
                happiness. To correct the Yo-Yo syndrome which happiness
                swings into. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">If what
                follows seems at times to be circuitous and repetitive;
                the ploy is intentional. To begin with, everyone has the
                potential and the capabilities to become, to be this
                which we call happiness. We are going to explore a
                process over and against a backdrop that relies upon an
                individuals' conscious decision and conscious effort. A
                commitment which asks of the participant to maintain an
                intense intentional disciplined mind, body and spirit. A
                resolute determination that allows and empowers both the
                choice and the effort. Plus, the needed expertise of
                discrimination that is vigilant in choosing between, the
                lesser and the greater, between the good, the better and
                the more excellent.&nbsp;Which life is offering up on a
                moment by moment basis. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In previous
                writings and conversations, we have said in effect; that
                happiness is not an end, in and of itself. If one
                chooses to run after this elusive gift, to seek after,
                they will never find it. Happiness has that strange
                affinity to find us. It is in a way a by-product which
                rises up like a Phoenix out of the intangibles of life.
                One might say that happiness is an outgrowth of ones'
                self-knowledge, self-understanding&nbsp;along
                with&nbsp;an awareness; that everything created comes
                from the <em>Womb of Creation</em>. Happiness also
                comes out of the continuous feedings of Truth, Beauty,
                Goodness and Love. And the many other meta-values and
                priorities. And that, whatever is contrary and
                counter-productive to these higher qualities of living
                negates "Happiness". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">All negation
                and negativity is due in part,&nbsp;as to&nbsp;how far
                we have distanced ourselves from who and what we were
                created to be, i.e., our very Being, our Ultimate
                Nature.&nbsp; The further away we are from that which we
                were created to be. The further away we are from our
                Source, the <strong>ALL IN ALL</strong>. And the
                Eternal Womb, out of which we were given&nbsp;the Breath
                of life. It is this very distance which precludes and
                lessens our chances for fulfillment and happiness. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We move away
                or move towards, in and through, what we think or do not
                think. What we do or what we do not do. The contents of
                our daily thoughts and deeds&nbsp;are essential to our
                well-being. As is&nbsp;our seeing, hearing, sensing and
                the feeling of reality as it is. The call has always
                been to awaken, to see, to hear, to be aware and alive
                as to what is going on, inside and out. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This
                separation from, need not exist if we are aware,
                consciously aware and alive to the moments of life. Many
                have a shovel and hammer in hand, as they dig their own
                graves and build their own coffins. Life is for the
                living. "Let the dead bury the dead." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">To span the
                divide so we might return back, it is necessary that we
                remove the scales from our eyes and the wax from our
                ears, as we shake ourselves awake. So we can see, can
                hear, can be aware and alive to all the gifts and graces
                we have been given. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">One day during
                my walk of the Fifty-States of America. I entered <strong>Yellowstone

                  National Park</strong> located in Bozeman, Montana.
                After quenching my thirst, I visited the Park Ranger
                Station to get a Wilderness Camping Permit which allows
                one to camp in a special designated location far beyond
                the lower public camping areas and the more traveled
                hiking trails. Each camping site in this special area is
                a quarter a mile apart. Allowing greater privacy and
                solitude. The Wilderness Permit that I acquired placed
                my campsite seven miles up towards the timberline,
                besides a beautiful idyllic lake that had upside down
                mirrored trees lining its' shores. Plus a flock of
                Mallard ducks and the gathering of&nbsp; Elk as they
                quenched their thirst. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It was on the
                second day when&nbsp;I had decided to explore the area.
                Just as I was about to leave, a sound ripped through the
                forest, attacking and shredding every vestige of silence
                with the rapidity of a hundred chain-saws. I moved
                towards the onslaught as the piercing wail grew louder
                with each step I took. Point of interception was just
                around the approaching corner of a stand of Birch trees.
                We were close, the sound and I. And there just down the
                narrow path, walking towards me, was a machine supported
                by two arms and two legs. I was in hope that the bearer
                of the squawking machine spoke English. And that he had
                a bit of hearing left, in at least one of his ears if
                that was at all possible. The sound was still
                bludgeoning the air with a volume that would have made <em>Thor</em>,
                the god of Thunder sound like a surrogate. All of nature
                was in a state of shock. The silence and the
                tranquillity that had existed when I had opened my eyes
                that morning and said; "Good morning, World!" had ran
                away and hid. I could picture all the creatures big and
                small, scurrying for safety amid the crashing clamor, as
                if the "hounds of hell" were snipping at their flanks. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The young
                bearer of the "boom box" was completely obvious to "all
                and everything" in sight and sound. Except for that
                which was exploding the ear drums (mine, seemly not
                his). Although I had already concluded that I was about
                to deal with someone who was stone deaf. And if he
                wasn't by now, he would certainly be in need of a faith
                healer in not the too distant future. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I began with
                my best imitation of a frantic flag-man trying to stop a
                run-away freight train. He stopped but the music didn't.
                We stood there locked in a sound warp. The World
                momentarily disappeared behind the wall of sound. I am
                sure out of sheer fright. It appeared as though he was
                trying to read my lips. I gave him the old radio sign
                (for cut) "cool it". Afterwards I thought, he probably
                thought I might be trying to tell him I was about to
                commit suicide. If the sound had continued much longer,
                I might have considered it. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">He reduced the
                sound level of the thunder maker to just below the
                ground noise of a Boeing 747. And with what seemed to be
                a great effort of thought, words came forth; "Yeah, what
                seems to be your problem man?" "Problem", I said; "I
                don't have a problem. But I believe you and I are about
                have a problem as I shouted above the "boom!, boom!" I
                just thought, possibly you might consider refrigerating,
                cooling it for awhile. And shut down your "sound
                studio". Because I just saw a squirrel and two chipmunks
                running for cover with cotton stuck in their ears. Plus,
                the female Elks can't hear the male Elks calling them. I
                thought that someone who likes music wouldn't want to
                spoil a little love-making. And besides, if you don't
                decide to turn that mega-monster off, you will be
                wearing it around your neck as a relic. Am I getting
                through to you?" </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The young man
                stared at me, as though I had dropped down from a
                distant planet. And then his eyes saw the bull-whip and
                the large Bowie knife hanging from my belt. The Music
                stopped and we keep on dancing. No, that is not what
                happened... What happened was; once the music stopped,
                the silence became deafening. Or maybe the air was just
                gasping, trying to catch its' breath. Or maybe I was
                starting to go deaf. And then I heard the stammering
                words of the young man say; "I didn't realize the music
                was so loud." (if it had been any louder, the mountains
                would have crumbled and the falls would not have fallen,
                anymore) It was at this point he confirmed my earlier
                suspicion, his ear canals had melted. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I thanked him
                for shutting down the sound factory. He turned and
                disappeared down the mountainside. I drew a sigh of
                relief and wondered when the woodland inhabitants would
                come out of hiding, and the ground would stop its'
                shake, rattle and roll. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In walking the
                world, visiting the sights and sounds of the world's
                remaining listed wonders. The Art Museums, the
                Architectural Monuments, all the must see things that
                grace the tourist folders and posters. And in hearing
                the collective Oohs! and Aah,s and all the other
                descriptive superlatives. I have often thought, why is
                it that we reserve our "wow's" and exclamation sounds
                just for the tourists' Mecca's of the World, when there
                are so many wonderment's and beauty to our left and on
                our right. And in front of our steps throughout life.
                There are a thousand and one things, we take so much for
                granted each and everyday. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Have you ever
                wondered? How many people who awaken each and every
                morning breathing, just breathing ever take the time
                during the day to give thanks for the gift of breath. Or
                upon opening their eyes at the start of each day whether
                they are ever grateful for the gift of seeing? Or upon
                hearing someone speak; are they appreciative for the
                gift of hearing? Do they ever, ever think on these
                things? </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">What keeps us
                from seeing, from being aware of the breathing's of
                life,&nbsp; Our we thankful for the very essence of each
                moment. Of all the multiplicities of life. Of the many
                blessings whether of the sky or the earth? Of the days
                and nights? Above or below, the within and the
                without?&nbsp; Why is it so hard for us to give thanks?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We see, when
                we do not see. We hear, when we do not hear. Because of
                our insistence, our belief and certainty, that we are
                awake. But with all due respect many are asleep while
                appearing to be awake and saying they are awake. In a
                way it is similar to when one says; he or she is fine,
                that there is nothing wrong, they feel quite well. When
                it is evident, plain to see that everything is not all
                right. That there is something wrong and that by all
                appearances, they are not well. It is rare that we see
                things as they really are, their <em>such-ness</em>,
                their <em>is-ness</em>. Our moments of lucid awareness
                are fleeting, momentary glimpses, quick insights
                of&nbsp;the possible potentialities. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">One of the
                reasons for our flawed perceptions is due to the fact
                that we allow our biases, prejudices, needs, wants,
                fantasies, defenses and faulty sensory perceptions to
                exclude the reality of the in-coming data needed to
                structure Reality as it is. Not as we wish it to be... </span></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Two men were
                  seated outside a cafe in South Sinai, and a camel
                  walked by. One man said to the other; "What does that
                  camel&nbsp;remind you of?" The second man answered;
                  "Food." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">"I didn't
                  know that you ate camel." And the second one replied
                  again; "Oh!, it is not that, you see everything
                  reminds me of food"</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">A loaf of
                bread looks different, when one is hungry. This is why,
                one spends less in the grocery store when they shop on a
                full stomach. Unless one is an incurable impulse buyer.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">But not only
                is our awareness sadly affected by our closing off the
                outside input through our predisposition's and filtering
                systems. Our awareness is also stunted and diminished
                because of our auto-matizing and the rubricizing of
                life. Along with our insatiable need to classify,
                catalogue and categorize everything and anything.
                Whether we are correct in our presuppositions&nbsp;or
                our assumptions, or not. We are also incurable
                organizers. If reality was re-presented by single pieces
                of a jig-saw puzzle.There would be those who would
                organize a committee, to shave the edges of the pieces.
                To make them fit their believed reality even if they
                were incorrect. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In past
                writings , we have referred to the many rooms which we
                can walk in and out of, once we have the keys to the
                doors and step inside.We have also mentioned that
                special room that allows one entrance into the <em>Infinity

                  Room</em> with its' awareness window that opens out
                onto the Realities of the World, the Universe, the
                Cosmos and even beyond the beyond. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As we find
                ourselves in the midst of all there is, we have a
                chance, the opportunity to see within the thus-ness and
                the synchronization&nbsp;of "all and everything".A
                connective-ness, a unitive paradigm wherein, all parts
                becoming the whole. Reminding us of our own affinity and
                beginnings; when we were One with "all and everything"
                and One with <strong>The Ineffable, The Indescribable,
                  The Unutterable</strong>. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is in this
                knowing, this Image we hold within, which demands us to
                be more aware, more alive. More knowledgeable and
                understanding. To re-define, to re-posture and maximize
                who we really are. This Image, this I am-ness calls us
                into becoming and being that which we were created to be
                and which we are. The expressed Image of the <strong>All

                  in All</strong>, the <strong><span
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">IMAGE of all
                    images</span>. </strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As we
                re-define, re-posture and maximize ourselves, we need to
                walk the revealed realities. To daily make them a part
                of us, our own flesh and blood. So that one might
                restore their former "Self" and live a balanced,
                harmonious life. That abundant life which is our
                heritage, our birthright. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Several
                paragraphs back, we said that we "structure our own
                realities, about all and everything." And in doing so;
                we tailor, mold and shape it, making reality in our own
                image to suit us. Out of our own imperfections,
                weaknesses and our lack of awareness. And because of
                this faulty structuring, the World, the people and the
                things of the world, are misrepresented. We see and hear
                what we want to see and hear. Our sight is out of focus
                and our hearing is suspect. Seldom will we admit that we
                need a general overhaul, some new designing and
                re-tooling. A need for a new programmer to delete some
                of the old programming. Updating our attitudes, our
                posturing and all our negativity. And do something about
                our "windows of perception." Our old windows are
                inadequate for seeing Reality as it is. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is not only
                sad but a bit puzzling that so many believe, see or feel
                that the World is not to great a place to live in. They
                are like those who when given a glass of water that is
                only half full, say it is half empty instead of saying
                it is half full.They are the very same people when given
                an apple; look to see if there is a worm
                inside.&nbsp;They are the very same people who open a
                gift horse's mouth and count it's teeth?&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">A
                few&nbsp;years back there was a very famous cartoonist,
                who has since died, by the name of Al Capp. Who at that
                time had a Syndicated Cartoon-Strip called <strong>L'il
                  Abner</strong>. One of the regulars that appeared in
                the strip was called "Joe Gloom". As Joe walked through
                the story line, there was always a little white cloud
                perched over his head. A little white cloud that cried.
                And wherever "Joe Gloom" went, the cloud was sure to
                follow. And you could bet the farm that rain always
                followed the little white cloud. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I have lost
                count in my lifetime of all the many "Joe and Joan
                Glooms" I have met along the way both the young and the
                old alike. The "Glooms" of this world have a favorite
                pastime. They just love to cloud up and rain all over
                your parade. Or anyone else's, if given half a chance.
                They just can't wait to share their "doom and gloom"
                philosophy about the world, the people and the things of
                this world. Like "Henny Penny", the sky is always
                falling. Nothing is ever right, well, seldom right. And
                please do not ask them how they feel. You will wish you
                hadn't. They have a litany of "woes and ills" that would
                make a wooden Indian say "Ugh." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is
                downright shame, some do say; that so many people prefer
                to walk down the streets of life among the shadows.
                Instead of walking on the sunny side of the street, like
                the song goes;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">"Grab your
                coat and get your hat.<br>
                And leave your worries on the doorstep.<br>
                And just direct your feet to the sunny side of the
                street."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is just as
                easy if not easier, to look for the silver lining. The
                more positive instead of the negative. The best things
                in life, instead of the dark side of life. You know what
                they say;&nbsp;"the best things in life are free.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Besides the
                words of the song just mentioned, there were two other
                songs that were favorite requests from the audience in
                the late forties, when I would ask for requests. And I
                have always believed that the reason for their
                popularity was that intuitively, we believe if we don't
                ignore it. That the positive approach to life is far
                better than the "doom and gloom" scenario. One of the
                songs was entitled; <strong>You've Got To Accentuate
                  the Positive</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">You've got to
                accentuate the positive.<br>
                Eliminate the negative.<br>
                And don't mess with Mr.-in-Between.<br>
                You've got to spread joy.<br>
                Up to the maximum<br>
                And keep gloom,<br>
                Down to the minimum.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And the
                second, highly requested song was; <strong>The Best
                  Things in Life Are Free</strong> </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The moon,
                belongs to everyone.<br>
                The best things in life are free.<br>
                The sun, belongs to everyone.<br>
                It shines there, for you and me.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The flowers in
                spring,<br>
                The robins that sing,<br>
                The sunbeams that shines,<br>
                There yours, their mine.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And love can
                come to everyone,<br>
                The best things in life are free.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is
                important, no, it is imperative for us to learn how to
                become aware, be aware. Become alive, be alive. Become
                thankful, be thankful. With each breath we breathe from
                now to the grave. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">To be aware,
                alive and thankful for the world; with all its' many
                contrasts, all its' gifts and graces, all the
                impressions and expressions. Its' "all and everything
                "for us to daily embrace and enter into communion with.
                What a joy! What a living joy! </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Every
                expression, every impression we receive through our
                sensory centers are just waiting to teach us about life
                and all its' wonderment's. If we have the eyes and ears
                to see and hear. And the mind to think and the
                discrimination for the choosing between the lesser and
                the greater. And the e-motion, the energy to feel, to
                sense, to be aware of "<em>all and everything"</em>
                which carries the imprint, the reflection, the <strong>Will

                  of the Image</strong> the <strong>All in All</strong>...

                If we will but open ourselves up and embrace this
                Presence that is in "<strong>all and everything"</strong>,
                take it into ourselves and let it feed us, sustain us,
                become us and be us. We will be as one, with the One. <strong>The

                  WILL of Wills.</strong> </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We have been
                given everything we need to unlock the unknown and the
                invisible mysteries of all there is or will be. So that
                we might find out who and what we are. And because this
                is so; our first order of business is one of
                thanksgiving, an attitude of gratitude for the many
                things we share in. A daily appreciation for those
                things that are unseen, beyond our normal perception.
                Those subtle fields of quarks, black holes, sun spots
                and bursts. All the gravitational pulls of the orbital
                paths and there sling shot passing. And those invisible
                warps of wave lengths and high frequency vibrations. All
                which are part and parcel for the overall design and
                system of the Universe and beyond. There is no doubt
                that there are&nbsp;far more things unseen than seen.
                The invisible far out weighs the visible. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We share,<br>
                The same, <em>Breath of Life</em><br>
                As do all things.<br>
                We breathe in the <em>Breath of Creation</em><br>
                Which comes out of the Absolute <em>Void</em>,<br>
                That Body of Love</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This <em>Breath

                  of Love</em><br>
                Which gives out of its' Abundance.<br>
                Which gives Unconditionally,<br>
                All things, above and below.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This
                Unconditional Love, out of which all the existing
                abundance has come is never taken away. "Never," you
                say. How about that last breath? No, not even then, this
                <em>Breath of Life</em>, holds and sustains, above and
                below, never letting go. And this <em>Love</em>, is
                non-negotiable, it knows only to give, forever giving.
                It gives because it must give, this is the nature of
                Love with a capital "L",&nbsp;whether Divine or human.
                Love wants only the most excellent for the lover. This
                love asks, only asks; what is the most loving thing I
                can do for the loved one. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And across
                time comes the answer: </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>'Always

                  give that which is the more excellent of yourself to
                  another'. </strong>The key words; yourself and the
                more excellent. Which requires, if one wants to be the
                channel of the giving of love. To become and be love. So
                as to mirror the more excellent eternal values, or as
                some say, the meta-values; <strong>Truth, Goodness,
                  Beauty</strong> and <strong>Love</strong>, to mention
                only a few. So that the lover can give to his or her
                loved one that which they have become The reflection of
                the more excellent. In this way the lover can help in
                the empowering of another. So that they might have the
                possibility to become and be; Who and what, they were
                intended, created to be. That which they have always
                been but have forgotten.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">You probably
                thought, we wandered off and forgot all about this thing
                called "Happiness". No!, No! All that has been said, in
                my repetitive way up to this point has been related and
                is essential if we are to become and be 'happy'.
                Happiness is a by-product of how we view ourselves and
                others. How we perceive life and the World in general,
                to be. How we structure our realities. How we are in the
                World but not of it. How we become and be the best we
                can become and be. How we&nbsp; incarnate the Higher
                Values, those Qualities that are the best of us. How we
                become and be all these things; in thought, word and
                deed. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">All the
                rhetoric, all the words, all the reactions and
                actions&nbsp;become a back-drop for the weaving of this
                tapestry of Happiness. Happiness rises up out of many,
                many things we say, we experience.&nbsp;In a way it is
                out of the serendipity of just living, really living in
                that ever present energy flow. It comes out of all the
                impressions and expressions that life offers up to us on
                a daily basis. Out of everything we embrace and that
                which embraces us. It is an outgrowth of all the
                teachings, wisdom, disciplines, etc., known and unknown.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Happiness
                comes out of a holistic approach: the fusing of&nbsp;our
                mind, body and our spiritual dimensions. It could be
                said that happiness reaches its' peak as each individual
                becomes aware of their I-ness and the Thus-ness of "<strong>all

                  and everything"</strong> As one partakes of the
                essence of each reality he or she embraces. As one
                stands in awe and wonderment of all of Creation. While
                realizing at the same time; that everything that is
                needed for our own welfare and the welfare of the world
                has been given, above and below. And on seeing this, we
                allow our spirit to unite and flow with the Creative
                Spirit. Out of this awareness will come a perpetual flow
                of thanksgiving. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is during
                this flow of awareness and thanksgiving that we
                realize&nbsp;happiness. A happiness that walks hand in
                hand with awareness and alive-ness and is joined by
                thanksgiving. And it is <strong>all for one and one for
                  all</strong>. Each empowering, nurturing and
                energizing one another. And in this process of becoming
                and being, we become aware of the unitive supportive
                system of all of Creation. And as we have always
                suspected, we are family. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In due time we
                come to that knowing, that all things work in unison,
                that everything is connected. That balance and harmony
                is the daily order, forever and ever. All things work
                for, not against each other. And that every dot and
                tittle are part of this connective-ness, no one or no
                thing is left out of the schema, this unitive paradigm.
                Whether we are talking about the hierarchical order of
                the developmental process, or the evolution of the
                higher cosmic levels of consciousness. Or the cycles of
                Creation; birth, death and rebirth. Or the birthing,
                crawling, walking and the running of the good race. As
                is found in the many methodologies, disciplines,
                philosophies, religions and the esoteric psychology's
                which attempt to spell out Reality. All are part of the
                <strong>Whole</strong>, the <strong>Holy</strong> (The
                Holy of Holies). </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">For anyone who
                is a serious seeker after; words are at best a crutch.
                They fall short of the mark, they ring with doubt and
                uncertainty, echoing the disparities of interpretation,
                evaluation and of value given to them. They blind, bind
                and imprison the spirit of humankind. They pretend to be
                the messengers, the saviors of the day. It is critical
                that we are aware of the weakness of our various
                consensual languages. And that interpretation needs to
                be replaced by the incarnation of the intent of such
                words as; Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Love. These words
                and others of their kind need to become and be our flesh
                and blood. If this elusive butterfly called "Happiness"
                is to be ours on a permanent basis, we need to lay the
                foundation blocks so "Happiness"can be with us daily.
                Not just a now and then acquaintance. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The gifts of
                Nature, from the blade of grass to the starry nights.
                From a sip of water to the shinning seas. From the
                Breath we breathe to the breath of "all and everything"
                by the Breath of "All and Everything." As the song goes:
                "There yours there mine." All the Truth, Beauty,
                Goodness and Love is out there for the experience of
                becoming and being them. The choice is yours, it is
                mine. Are we going to fish or cut bait? </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The process we
                have been speaking about needs to have a conscious
                decision and effort on our part. A decision to travel a
                path that is for the most part infrequently traveled. A
                decision to seek after that "pearl of great price." What
                "pearl of great price"? It has been called by many names
                but defined by none. Only in becoming the definition,
                can it be defined. And this process of becoming passes
                through self-knowledge, self-understanding and into
                Being, all there is to be. Followed&nbsp;by a
                doing&nbsp;of&nbsp;the more excellent.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As we develop
                and experience the many paradigms and become them, there
                comes a different mode of seeing, hearing, feeling and
                sensing.&nbsp; An understanding blossoms, bringing
                awareness, alive-ness and thanksgiving. And the above
                triad energizes and engenders each other bringing new
                nuances of en-light-ment. Out from the wings of the
                stages of life&nbsp;comes; well-being, harmony and
                balance which spells ...... You guessed it, <em>'Happiness'</em>.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">A&nbsp;high
                energy of happiness bursts upon the scene and stands
                center-stage. Surrounded by a great supportive cast.
                Without which happiness can never reach its' full
                stature and a place among the pantheon of the stellar
                virtues of life. Of all virtues, happiness is a product
                of its' connective-ness with the thus-ness of all the
                supportive values of the becoming and being
                meta-morphous. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Let's bring
                together the essence of this thing called <strong>happiness</strong>
                with a few closing affirmations. Much of what we take to
                be happiness is but a shadow that vanishes, as the dawn
                of reality streams through the windows of our
                self-knowledge, self-understanding and Being. The
                pursuit of happiness is reminiscent of watching a small
                child's' attempt to catch a butterfly in flight.
                Happiness is not a dangling appendage, a part or a piece
                of, nor something one possesses or collects, as one
                collects things and bobbles to display now and then.
                Rather, happiness is an outgrowth of ones' Being, of
                being aware and alive which are the by-products of
                self-knowledge and self-understanding. That turns into
                our expressed image, the reflected image of the Willed
                Image out of the Void. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Happiness is
                not a static predetermined state. It is a
                self-perpetuating flow with a built in fluidity that is
                fed by many streams. A fully expanded consciousness, an
                awareness and an attitude of being alive and whole.
                Along with a posture of giving thanks, daily. For all
                the opulence of this world and the gifts of mind, heart
                and body. We have all we need for this thing called
                happiness. If we would but use what we have been given.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Well, we have
                said it over and over again, we have repeated the
                affirmations, forward and backward. Re-presented;
                options, alternatives, disciplines, methodologies, ways,
                means and instruments, speculations, premises,
                presuppositions, conjectures, beliefs, experiences. And
                oh, yes!, wisdom and truth. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">But as one
                knows, words are just so many words afloat in an ever
                increasing sea of words. Unless the word becomes flesh
                and blood. We will have a difficult time <em>walking
                  the talk</em>. Being that which we speak, <em>talking
                  the walk</em>. </span></p>
