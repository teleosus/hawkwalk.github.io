            <div><span>The land of the mountains. A city with the
                strange sounding name of <b>"Kathmandu"</b>. Nepal has
                eight mountains that tower over 8,000 meters. With the
                Granddaddy of all mountains reaching beyond the clouds
                to a height of {8,848} meters <b>"Sagarmatha"{Mount
                  Everest}</b>. This King of the mountains is the top
                drawing card for the shutterbugs; the seasoned and the
                amateur climbers, the tourist at large and the worlds'
                thrill seekers. During the two peak seasons for
                climbing, as many as 100 climbing permits can be issued,
                with the going price as high as $ 70,000 per. permit,
                for seven climbers. Quite a bonanzas for the two
                governments, Nepal and China. Not to mention the ad
                promotion for all the equipment that is used.</span>
              <p>But Nepal is not just about the challenge of climbing
                Everest or the other {8000 plus-meter} giants. Or the
                picture perfects postcards. This country of 25.5 million
                people is about a wide divergence in culture, traditions
                and customs. Nepal is among the poorest and the least
                developed countries in the world. Added to the
                impoverished living conditions; we can list illiteracy,
                substandard hygienic conditions, unemployment, a fifty
                percent mortality rate for children in their first five
                years, With adult mortality set at around fifty-eight
                years of age. We are not talking about a paradise or a
                Garden of Eden. But a country that is struggling to keep
                its' head above water. Or a country that is waiting for
                an accident to happen.</p>
              <p>The city of Kathmandu is a mix and match "hodge- pogh"
                of the old and the new. And this is especially true when
                one enters "Thamel". With the new restaurants sandwiched
                in-between the older ones. And the same being true of
                the hotels. Then we have the high tech cyber-shops, with
                wall to wall computers for the tourists' hotmail and
                yahoo. While the average Nepali's live in homes that
                still have dirt floors and outside washing and toilet
                facilities</p>
              <p>The noise level on the central streets of Thamel during
                the daytime could well be compared to the noise of a
                three- ring circus, calliope and all. That never lets'
                up. You have the hawkers with their "tiger balm" their
                "Buddha statues" and the famous Gorkha knife. Along with
                the beggars, the hashish and marijuana salesmen, The
                taxi drivers, the auto rickshaw drivers, the
                bicycle-rickshaws drivers yelling; "want a taxi, want a
                rickshaw". Now add to this, all the horns, whistles and
                the bicycle bells that never stop their honking and
                ringing. And the shop owners or their helpers saying;
                "hello or good morning, want to buy something". It is
                pure bedlam!</p>
              <p>And, if this is not enough, you have to walk or run the
                gauntlet once you enter the streets of Thamel. Did I say
                streets, they are not streets by any stretch of the
                imagination. They are oversized footpaths. Barely room
                for one car, with most of the storefronts to the very
                edge of the street. On these, "Lilliputian "streets that
                have no center line and no traffic rules as to what side
                of the street you drive on, or when and how you pass. It
                is a pedestrian's nightmare.</p>
              <p>The taxis, motorcycles, cars, trucks, vans, buses,
                rickshaws, tuk, tuks, mo-peds, bicycles and the "status"
                four wheelers are vying for this single lane, all at the
                same time. Pedestrians beware!</p>
              <p>Insanity, Rules" the streets. The policemen who are
                stationed at various points in Thamel are just taking up
                space. The vehicles, which speed through the streets,
                risking life and limb, are invisible to the police.</p>
              <p>No vehicles should be allowed within the central
                streets of "Thamel". Deliveries and supplies should be
                made before ten-o-clock. All taxis, tuk, tuks, and
                rickshaws should be ticketed if they are in the area
                after ten, unless they are dropping off Hotel or
                Guesthouse patrons. I have no doubt the owners of
                businesses within the area are fighting any changes that
                might be suggested to solve the utter confusion that
                exists in the streets of Thamel.</p>
              <p><span>Of course the sensible solution would be to
                  relocate this Tourist hotspot to an area closer to the
                  airport. With some far-sighted city planning and
                  proper zoning laws, that would be enforced. Along with
                  enforced laws and rules to expedite the traffic. But
                  here again, the power structure, the landowners,
                  politicians and the special interest groups will get
                  around to doing something, probably when the "ice age"
                  returns. </span></p>
              <span></span>
              <p><span>The one redeeming feature about Nepal is the
                  genuine hospitality of the general population. But the
                  down side of Nepal lies within the business sector.
                  Here we are talking about lack of efficiency, service
                  and ethics. Plus the glaring discrepancy of over
                  pricing across the board. The profit scale is out of
                  proportion. In light of a figure of $ 212.00 per
                  capita income a year and a failing economy. Some
                  owners are gaining a hundred to two hundred per cent
                  mark-up at the expense of the tourist trade. But as
                  has been proven in the past. The tourists industry;
                  "can kill the goose that lays the golden egg". The
                  business philosophy seems to ape some of the
                  politicians' philosophy. "Get in and get as much as
                  you can. Even though the goose may die". </span></p>
              <p>There are a number of factors that must be addressed if
                Nepal is to leave its' backward stance and its' portrait
                of being one of the lesser developing countries in the
                world. Of course the writer is aware that there is no
                simplistic answer. And that the elements to be mentioned
                cannot be isolated. Each affects one another, or spawns
                one another. All, need to be corrected for a good
                society to exist and serve its' people.</p>
              <p>So what are some of these negative factions that
                hinder, instead of engendering and enhancing the general
                "good". There is a problem of illiteracy that hovers at
                73 per cent of the population. Of those who are
                literate; 40 per cent our male and 14 per cent are
                female. Now one does not have to be an Einstein to
                figure out the disproportion that exists in these
                figures. And that education&nbsp;should be the number
                one priority for the country.</p>
              <p><strong>That goes for every country.</strong></p>
              <p>The above mentioned, leads us into the next factor. The
                existing poverty level which stands at 42 per cent. How
                utterly demoralizing, dehumanizing, degrading, unfair
                and uncalled for in this day and age. Who is
                responsible? The government, "yes", but all are
                responsible. Is there some light, at the end of the
                tunnel? "Yes", a little, but not enough. The private
                schools cannot solve the total problem of educating the
                masses, simply because the cost is prohibitive. The
                government must raise the needed monies to subsidize
                education. So that every child has the opportunity to be
                educated. No child should be penalized, by refusing to
                give him or her an education. And while speaking of
                "her", let us not forget' that it is the woman that
                shoulders the greater responsibility in the rearing and
                nurturing of the child. So it is equally important that
                the woman be educated. Tell me, that a woman doesn't
                need to be educated!</p>
              <p>And lastly, but not really; there is the matter of
                "Human rights". The Constitution of Nepal is bound to
                protect and provide the basic human rights to its'
                citizens {children, women, laborers and the oppressed
                classes}. And "yes" even the rights of the Maoists.</p>
              <p>In the same light, the Constitution reads; "no news
                item, article or any other reading material shall be
                censored". No press shall be seized or closed for any
                news item printed".</p>
              <p>It is no secret that journalists, who criticize the
                rampart corruption in the government and its officials,
                are oppressed. Ten journalists have been arrested this
                year. In 1998, eight newspapers were seized. In the same
                year, two journalists disappeared while in police
                custody. No society can condone, these kinds of
                travesties again its' own citizenry.</p>
              <p>The last travesty is that of corruption. As the saying
                goes; "power corrupts". And this becomes so true in
                governments and some of its' officials. But it does not
                stop at this level. It trickle's down, all the way down
                into the grass roots. In other words it becomes the
                acceptable thing to do. For you hear; "well, everybody
                else is doing it, I might as well get a piece of the pie
                myself'. No society, no country, or individual can
                become and fulfill their intended destiny in a corrupt
                environment.</p>
              <p>There are other factors, that affect the above
                mentioned societal deficiencies. Such as the existing
                caste systems and class distinctions held among the
                peoples of Nepal. Governmental struggles in the past two
                years with five different swings in leadership. With
                non-productive collations that cannot get their act
                together because of the power plays between them.
                Conflicting self-interests, greed and self-indulgences.
                And let us not leave out that old favorite "cronyism".</p>
              <p>Is there a solution, "yes"? The solution lies in the
                problem. Are the "powers to be" aware of the problems
                and the solution. Again the answer is "yes" What would
                be of a tremendous help. That the elected remember:
                "that the government is of the people and for the
                people". And this should never be forgotten, especially
                by these servants of the people. Those who should have
                the best interests of their constituency at heart.</p>
              <p>Having said all this; the number one priority is still.
