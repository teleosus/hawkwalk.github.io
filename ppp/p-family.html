                not come, when one but listens or reads the printed
                word. Words receive meaning from experience and then
                comes knowledge. The sequence is<span

                  style="text-decoration: underline;">experience,

            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">When we know;
                the word becomes explicit and alive for us. We know
                because we know. In this process; becoming the word. The
                person becomes the definition. Reality is marked, it
                just <strong>is</strong>. The Person, the Word, the
                Being is known for what it has proven to be so. It is
                that and nothing else; the enigmatic words out of the
                past is defined: "<strong>I am that I am</strong>".</span></p>
            <p>The human language is limited by its' very nature, it's
              finite-ness. It is caught in the grasp of a particular
              time and space. &nbsp;We do not experience the
              "Wholeness". We see but partially. We become fragmented.
              We filter everything through our fragmentation. As we
              write or speak; the "word" is seldom if ever the
              description of what it is.</p>
            <p>When we step into the different currents of;
              Meta-physics, Philosophy or Religion. &nbsp;The consensual
              languages of the human species fall short in communicating
              the invisible, the "Ineffable". Our words grow pale in the
              "Light". With all our skills and tools of rational,
              analytical and linear thinking; we find ourselves in a
              communication quandary as we try to delineate when we
              speak of the world, people and the things of the world via
              the medium of a singular consensual language, out of the
              many.</p>
            <p>To this confusion of tongues, we add our self-imposed
              limitations brought on by our biases and cultural
              pre-dispositions (parental, societal and peer programming)
              which give the language in question its' different
              nuances, spin, and&nbsp;tuning, along with a variety of
              different connotations. All adds to our communication
              dilemma as the various languages try to coalesce.</p>
            <p>In exploring our own language and its' entourage of
              complexities that muddy the flow of our speech and
              communicative skills. One can see the inherent reasons for
              our misunderstandings and our inability to assess and
              solve our communal&nbsp;deficiencies.&nbsp;The
              difficulties arise and are&nbsp;compounded by our various
              or differing developmental levels along with the skills
              and techniques of those involved in trying to communicate
              their particular brand of knowledge and understanding to a
              specific subject/object. As&nbsp;to its' reality and
              connective-ness to the "Whole" i.e.; the existence of "
              All and Everything".</p>
            <p>Then we have the difficulty of assessing the
              representations of our senses, i.e.; touch, smell, taste,
              sound, and vision. This becomes ever increasing so,
              because of the way we catalog, classify and categorize
              each and everything we perceive, according to our reality
              structuring.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              A reality, to suit our needs; &nbsp;to help us in our
              rationalizations, to justify our ways of thinking,
              speaking and doing. We walk, run and are&nbsp;driven by a
              self-made&nbsp;"relative&nbsp;reality".&nbsp;As we hurry
              and scurry to our "comfort zones, our enclaves that makes
              so many things invisible to our senses. Allowing us to
              separate ourselves from that which <strong>just is</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Point in Question:</strong></p>
            <p>Let us select a single word from our vocabulary of words.
              The word being " Man " And here we are using the word
              "Man" in the sense, as a representative word denoting
              "Humanity". How would you describe a&nbsp;man or woman;
              this phenomenon of Nature? &nbsp;What traits,
              characteristics, etc., &nbsp;would you portray? &nbsp;Who
              and what is this rarity, this unique being? What is his or
              her nature, his or her place in the schema of things? In
              twenty-five words or less, tell me the essence, the spirit
              of this creature?<br>
              <br>
              Let's enlarge our example by imagining a group of people
              (both genders) assembled. Some from the developed
              countries and the others from some of the lesser developed
              countries of the World. To speak about the "human
              species". And let's say that those assembled&nbsp;are out
              of various "Disciplines" and variant walks of life.
              &nbsp;People coming from different societal and
              educational structuring, cultures, traditions, religions
              and parental role-models, {good, bad or indifferent}. Some
              being; &nbsp;Educators, Physicians, Psychiatrists,
              Philosophers, Religionists, Scientists, Anthropologists,
              and Theologians. And while we are at it, throw in a panel
              of "Everyman/woman", the blue and white collar workers.
              How would each of these portray the " Modern Human Being?
              &nbsp;I am sure you get the point.<br>
              <br>
              Agreeing on a specific definition, such as the definition
              of the "Human Species", or whatever the defining subject
              or object, might be. Can turn into a larger than life
              communications problem. Why?</p>
            <p>Because there are many contingencies that affect and
              influence our ability to say what we mean and mean what we
              say. But one of the major factors; is the way, we
              structure our reality. Because everyone structures their
              own reality to some degree. Out of an endless list of
              inputs: certain options, alternatives, values, morals,
              ideologies. peer, societal and parental programming,
              preferences, likes and dislikes, taste, fads, fantasies
              and the list goes on and on.<br>
              <br>
              As we see or do not see, think or do not think, or feel it
              to be; so is our reality. Our perception and awareness of
              the World in general, as well as of people and things set
              the stage for our alive-ness or deadness. Nor
              should&nbsp;we forget the importance of how we see
              ourselves. As to how we fit in the schema of " All and
              Everything".<br>
              <br>
              If we are ever going to get to know and understand one
              another. It is vital that we become aware of the dynamics
              of how we see, feel, hear and act? &nbsp;Why we say and do
              what we say and do? Out of what frames of reference, do we
              take in and give out?<br>
              <br>
              If we can begin to see, to know, to understand, the whys
              and wherefores that influence our perceptions. As to who
              we are,&nbsp;as to the World and the things of the
              World.&nbsp;While at the same time come&nbsp;to terms with
              the limitations of our consensual languages. Realizing
              that there is a need to explore and develop a diversity of
              paradigms in which the full potentialities and
              possibilities of our minds, bodies, and spirit might be
              realized, here and now. If this could come to pass, we, as
              well as the entire Universe would be the benefactors.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;I would hasten to add; there is a need for us to
              ask ourselves at every point along the way. Is this <strong>what
                is</strong> or is it an imitation, a copy? &nbsp;Is what
              I am seeing, hearing and sensing; the <strong>real</strong>
              or the <strong>unreal</strong>, the <strong>truth</strong>
              or the <strong>false</strong>, the <strong>light</strong>
              or the <strong>darkness</strong>? Is my thinking <strong>whole</strong>
              or <strong>fragmentary</strong>? Am I seeing things as
              they are or as I wish them to be?</p>
            <p>Can one know beyond thought? And here I do not speak of
              substituting faith for thought. Because faith is also out
              of the realm of our thoughts. &nbsp;As we have said prior;
              all thinking is fragmentary because it lacks the
              cohesiveness and consistency. It is flawed from out of our
              past and continues to be so. And because this&nbsp;is so,
              we are both the problem and the answer.<br>
              <br>
              In&nbsp;many ways, we are still babes in the crib,
              stringing our filtering beads. Saying; " Is this all there
              is&nbsp;"? " What's so great about life "? It is evident
              that much of our communication, whether the areas be
              personal, societal, political or commercially oriented,
              (spoken or print) that all are affected by the
              predominance of the shadows blocking out the light. Gloom
              and doom ride across the spectrum of speech and print. Who
              would disagree; we are in need of more
              "&gt;en-light-en-ment in so many things. More Light, more
              Light is the needed&nbsp;call.<br>
              <br>
              Is it then, any wonder that we have a hard time saying
              what we mean or mean what we are saying. Or hearing what
              is being said; over the internal static that interferes
              with our reception and perception. How many times have we
              said; whenever or wherever problems arise. &nbsp;Usually,
              the human race can be found in the thick of it, milling
              around about; adding to the confusion and turmoil. We have
              become negligent in our husbandry. With too many sowing
              seeds of discontentment; disorder and strife, dissension
              and suspicion, mistrust and fear. It is a"
              puzzlement"&nbsp;that we can communicate at all.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>
              Instead of sowing those seeds that nurture and enhance.
              Seeds that give a sense of value and meaning to life.
              Which&nbsp;gives each person a sense of inheritance and
              thanksgiving for all they have been given. We settle for
              "weed" seeds.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The most important seed of all. The seed of "free will",
              that free choice&nbsp;which can flourish into
              self-knowledge and self-understanding of who and what we
              are. There is no doubt that if we could or would perceive
              ourselves differently; our answers would be different, as
              would our questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, there would
              come that time when there would be no further need to ask
              more questions. For we would know that we know.</p>
            <p>Before someone cries out that I am being
              unrealistic&nbsp;about communication in general. I would
              defer and quickly add; that there is a type, a level of
              speaking, a "speak-speak" which deals with the trivial and
              the frivolous; the gossip and the gutter, the inane and
              the mundane. Along with only&nbsp;fleeting glimpses of the
              "real", now and then. &nbsp;More often, there are long
              voyages into the ridiculous. Too little of the sublime, I
              am afraid.<br>
              <br>
              A "talk-talk" that deals with surface terminology borne
              out of our automatized and rubricized learning. Add to
              this the language that our professions and jobs nurture.
              A&nbsp;language anemia&nbsp;sets in.&nbsp;As creativity,
              imagination, spontaneity, and&nbsp;aliveness. Die on the
              vine. Bowing&nbsp;to the built-in rubrics and tailored
              language of the accepted "norms" of the specific groups,
              we belong too. A mimicry and a parroting of what is
              acceptable or expected, to protect the "status quo". Those
              "rites of passage" within the&nbsp;consensual groups with
              their "pecking order" and their "kangaroo court" mindset.
              &nbsp;Which&nbsp;can castrate without the sacrificial
              lamb;&nbsp;the knowledge that is trying to break through?<br>
              <br>
              <strong>An in -the-house-memo:</strong><br>
              <br>
              The mindset, we have just painted; can be found and
              observed at cocktail and Corporate parties. In the
              Corporate boardrooms, the evening gatherings of
              pub-bonding where all those male things are discussed and
              rehashed. Those male myths that&nbsp;rise up out of the
              inane and the banal. &nbsp;As the locker room mentality
              rules and runs rampant. But let us not forget our female
              counterparts, with their coffee and tea chatters.&nbsp;The
              over the fence dialogues, along with the never-ending
              "chit chat" marathons via the cellphones. This is probably
              why someone quipped. "words are cheap". &nbsp;Has it not
              been said;&nbsp;"actions speak louder than words".<br>
              <br>
              It seems as long as one sticks to the "meat and potato"
              subjects, we have less trouble with our communication. It
              is when we begin to delve into the life and speak about
              the problems of the human condition. Leaving the surface
              arena and reaching beyond the same -O, same-O dialogue
              about the kids, weather, the news, sports, the gripes and
              the complaints, the job, the boss, the Government, the
              in-laws and the neighbors' sex life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When one starts to talk about the "inner-space", the
              interiors of life. There is a lull that settles over the
              conversation, a red light starts flashing, " danger,
              danger." A security breach is in progress. "Comfort zones"
              are being threatened, they are under attack.&nbsp;Our
              identity&nbsp;is being questioned."<br>
              <br>
              When we step out of the humdrum, life as usual; the 'nine
              to five beat'. Into the paradigms or dimensions of the
              mind and the spirit, which are but the extension of our
              constitutionally. We&nbsp;are like fish out of water. Can
              you remember the last time you were in a conversation?
              When such words as; Truth, Beauty, Goodness, and Love
              surfaced, No? Yes? What was your reaction? Were you
              interested, fearful, anxious, bored, ambivalent, or just
              out of it?&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              One is lead to believe that part of our problem lies in
              the fact that are consensual language is inadequate to
              communicate our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Of
              course, the language cannot bear the full brunt of the
              weakness. Our analytical-linear, sequential thought
              process, limits our self-knowledge and self-understanding
              of "who and what we are". Also of the World and the things
              of the World.<br>
              <br>
              Who of us, if we were truthful would deny that we as
              humans have&nbsp;an inner weakness and a&nbsp;poverty of
              spirit that&nbsp;contributes to our communication dilemma.
              &nbsp;We can be if we choose&nbsp;to be; &nbsp;the<strong>
                definitive definition</strong> of Truth, Beauty,
              Goodness, and Love. We can define ourselves and know that
              we know; the "Reality" of these four&nbsp;<strong>Life-Giving&nbsp;</strong>words.
              We will&nbsp;cease to be fragmented in our thinking and
              doing.</p>
            <p>This insight;&nbsp;this seeing into&nbsp;needs to become
              a personal search. &nbsp;As is said, one may lead one to
              the door <strong>but they cannot open it for that person</strong>.
              The opening of the door and entering in is one of personal
              choice and effort.</p>
            <p><br>
              I hope that we have not gone too far astray from where we
              started. &nbsp;It is important that we become aware of the
              difficulty and the necessity of communicating; "who and
              what" we are and where we are going.&nbsp;How we feel,
              think and see this Human Enterprise. This; we call living
              with all its connotations. If we deny or run away from
              this responsibility of knowing and understanding
              ourselves. We become the worst for it and so does the
              World. Because we are the World. Without us there is no
              World. For if there are no perceivers, no experience-rs,
              of what value is "Creation?".</p>
            <p>As someone once suggested; <strong>"an unexamined life
                is not worth living".</strong></p>
            <p>The conflict, confusion, disorder, dysfunction, misery,
              pain, sorrow, fear and guilt, violence, intolerance,
              prejudice, the isolation, loneliness, the tears, grief and
              despair. In all of&nbsp;these, we are the culprits. We
              also share in producing the greed, the selfishness, the
              pettiness, the deceit and deception, along with "I don"t
              give a damn and who cares" attitude! All these things we
              give to the World free of charge. And let's not forget the
              ignorance and stupidity that we add to the mix. As we stew
              and brew over&nbsp;the World's problems.<br>
              <br>
              And since we are the World; we are at the very&nbsp;center
              of the problems. How often have we glossed over the words;
              "<em>A better world begins with you and me".</em> Do we
              sincerely, profoundly, seriously believe this to be the
              truth and nothing but the truth. Or are they just like so
              many other words, that we have turned a deaf ear. We
              listen but we do not hear nor do we act. If our World is
              fragmented; it is because we are fragmented in both our
              thinking and our doing. The World we inherited was and is
              none of the things that we have listed. We have
              impregnated the World with the above viruses (conflict
              confusion and disorder, etc., etc.). We are the plague
              that has sweep across the face of the earth, leaving in
              its' wake, chaos and destruction. Simply because we have
              yet to figure out who and what we are? And why we are
              here? And where we are going? Until we un-fragment
              ourselves and <strong>Be and become&nbsp;whole</strong>.
              We as the Human race will continue to raise havoc. Not
              only in our own lives but in the lives of others and the
              World- at- large.<br>
              <br>
              A better World also depends upon how well we can
              communicate on all levels of human interaction. The
              teaching of Communication skills is paramount as we enter
              the 21st. century. The World is shrinking before our very
              eyes. Communication should be one of the primary concerns
              at all levels of education. With one of the&nbsp;major
              emphasis on teaching how to listen with both the eyes and
              the ears. Whether we are speaking about the pre-school
              level or on up through the post-graduate level. It is
              vital that the student is able upon Graduation to have the
              skills in listening, speaking and writing the consensual
              language, he or she is part of. Too many graduates at all
              levels are unable to read with a high level of
              comprehension. Or to speak and write with some semblance
              of clarity. It is rumored that only 14% percent of our
              Population&nbsp;is capable of comprehensive reading and
              writing.<br>
              <br>
              A good part of this deficiency rest within the
              developmental and psychological areas. Within the
              upbringing of the child as to his or her progressive needs
              and wants, as they move through their early formative
              years. Those needs that reach beyond food, shelter, and
              clothing. To being loved and accepted, the need for
              identity and recognition, etc., etc.. a la
              Maslow.&nbsp;But we will leave this for another time.<br>
              <br>
              Where were we? Oh, yes! Communicating. How often have we
              heard these words being uttered; "you just do not
              understand what I am trying to say to you". Or its'
              shorter version; "you don't understand me". I am not sure
              if we can ever know another person until we can know and
              understand ourselves (self-knowledge and
              self-understanding). Which seems to be a lifetime project.
              If it were possible in a one to one relationship for each
              to know and understand themselves. In that, they know who
              and what they are? Then the words;"you don't understand
              me" would not be spoken. Not only would we know our
              "is-ness", our oneness with " All and Everything" (our
              connective-ness). We would realize that we are family,
              capitalized. Our words would be;"One for all and all for
              one".&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Because of this possibility, it is important for all to
              seek out "The Energy" that binds everything to everything
              else. That Power, that Force that connects, that hooks
              every structure, combination, schema, system, a paradigm
              known and unknown, above and below, together. Any and all
              manifestations; until we ourselves are connected out of
              our awareness, our aliveness, our very being. So that
              knowingly, we are fused, merged and united with the sum
              total of " All and Everything" in the "<strong>All of All</strong>".
              In Reality, we are many things, but we are in need of
              being awake and aware to the Ultimate Truth; that we are
              part of a Complete Unitive System. We need to start
              connecting the dots.<br>
              <br>
              And until this connective-ness becomes our self-
              knowledge, our self-understanding, our very&nbsp;"Being".
              We will always be standing on the outside looking into the
              mirror of illusion. Like "Alice in Wonderland", we must
              step back through the mirror. So we can reflect Reality as
              it&nbsp;really is. We are separatists not by nature but by
              choice. We have and we still are separating ourselves from
              who and what we are. From that which <strong>just is the</strong>&nbsp;Original
              Intent i.e., the <strong>Will</strong>, the <strong>Power</strong>,
              the <strong>Force</strong>, the <strong>Creator</strong>,
              choose your word. We have polarized and dichotomized
              everything we have gotten our hands on. Leaving us in the
              either/or dimension, in no-mans' land. We are half-way
              people. Neither warm or lukewarm.<br>
              <br>
              Until we can learn to do away with both our dichotomizing
              and polarizing. And know with a certainty that
              "connective-ness is the "name of the game". We will always
              think and believe that we are "outsiders". All things
              beneath and above are necessary. For if this is not so, we
              would not be. The brilliance of the days is lengthening,
              as the darkness recedes. And whether we accept or like it,
              is beside the point. It is in the "Original Intent".<br>
              <br>
              This does not mean that all things will always be what
              they seem to be when they are not. Until that time comes
              when they will appear and be that which they have always
              been their true Reality. It is our lack of knowledge and
              fragmented thinking that causes the illusion of reality.
              True Reality is just behind the illusion. Waiting to be
              rediscovered.<br>
              <br>
              These illusions are also in part caused by our
              stubbornness, our insistence that we are awake, aware and
              alive when we are not.<br>
              <br>
              For the asleep say;"just look at what we have
              accomplished. All we have created. All the knowledge we
              have amassed. All the answers we have. All the
              technological advances in all the fields of human
              endeavor. We have outdone ourselves" (which may be truer
              than we think).<br>
              <br>
              "And you have the audacity to say; "That we are asleep,
              that we are not awake!" How preposterous, what a damning
              accusation"!<br>
              <br>
              But do we not see, that all the 'whistles, widgets and
              watcha-ma-call-its' do not complete the circle. The
              cure-all of the Scientific thrusts, the Industrial
              panaceas, the Techno-gratis solutions. All have fallen
              short of the mark, all the promises they have made are
              flawed. The consumer "manna" seemingly lacks the
              corrective and the restorative powers to feed mans' inner
              needs. The "poverty of spirit" is still prevalent. Even
              though in truth; we have everything we need if we were not
              so blinded by the superficial glow of affluence and
              success.<br>
              <br>
              In many ways, we are still babes of the woods, suckling at
              the breast of Nature. And only now and then, do we come up
              for breath and ask: "why are&nbsp;we living our lives in
              such "quiet desperation"? Why are we so poor in spirit?
              Why is it so hard for us to see, to hear, to be? Why, the
              seemingly lack direction, commitment, and discipline? Why
              the meaninglessness, the norm-less-ness, the apathy and
              the indifference? Along with the lack-lusterless and
              deadness? Why the dysfunctional and fragmented families?
              Why do we still have food insecurity existing in a World
              of plenty? The high rate of illiteracy? The
              ever-accelerating gap between the "haves" and the
              "have-nots"? The destruction of our Earth home away from
              home? The staggering violations of Human rights throughout
              all the World today? And the list is never ending.<br>
              <br>
              Instinctively, we know that knowledge for knowledge sake,
              as with technology, consumerism and materialism will not
              solve our dis-ease. nor will these things guarantee the
              needed growth and evolution for the Human species. Or
              answer the questions, we have created by default.<br>
              <br>
              Our well-being, our human-ness is in danger. If our
              outward and inner growth is not synchronized and attended
              to, by a balance of conscious decisions and effort, we
              will just continue on making the same old mistakes time
              after time. Our body, mind and spirit needs to evolve in
              tandem, as a unit and as we have said elsewhere the
              different consciousness levels need to join in this
              unitive exercise. Everything is connected, we are family.
              Why is it so difficult for us to embrace this? &nbsp;In so
              many ways, we are still crawling and trying very hard to
              stand and walk in an 'upright' position. We are babes who
              have lost our innocence and the Power that just is. We
              have&nbsp;forfeited many things during our descent.
              Hopefully, we can regain them and cut our loss as we
              ascend and take on higher levels of consciousness.<br>
              <br>
              To balance or rather counter-balance our technological
              thrusts and our acceleration in our consumer techno-world,
              along with our needed&nbsp;Space exploration to reach the
              outer limits of the Cosmos. We need a similar concentrated
              effort, in what some refer to as the "Inner Space
              Exploration". A going out beyond our Human nature; to new
              frontiers of the mind and spirit. To a connective-ness
              with " All and Everything". To the Origin and the "Intent"
              of our beginnings. An inner journey beyond the limits we
              have placed on our minds and spirit. Do we really know our
              possibilities, our potentialities? Why have we settled for
              less? We need to step outside the box.<br>
              <br>
              How many of us realize that we do not use all we have been
              given? All the gifts and graces; the opulence that goes
              beyond description. There is no reason, why? The
              technological advancement and our inner evolution can do
              so, side by side. With each enhancing and empowering each
              other. While at the same time, affirming one another.</p>

              to reach their individual heights, their fullest
              potentialities and possibilities. And in doing so, learn
              that "All and Everything" is linked, is part of a unitary
              bond which is sustained as we breath in. "<strong>The
                Power, The Will, The Force, The Love, The Compassion"</strong>
              (pick your semantics) that gave us our first breath and
              everything else. We need to re-discover the "Wholeness".
              the UNITY. Which are ones' individual choice and effort?
              We cannot pray it into being, think it into being, wish it
              into being, or hope it into being. If there is to be a
              transformation, a revolution. We need to accept the
              Reality;" that the buck stops on our front steps." Or to
              use a sports' analogy; "the ball is in your court". "You
              can either choose to fish or cut bait". What is it going
              to be?<br>
