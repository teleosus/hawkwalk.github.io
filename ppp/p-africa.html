            <p><strong>WHERE IT ALL BEGAN</strong></p>
            <p>My first introduction to the word "Africa" came as I sat
              in my grandfather's lap as&nbsp;he opened up the pages of
              &nbsp;the "National Geographic Magazine". I was one or two
              years of age. This became&nbsp;a&nbsp;monthly routine as
              each&nbsp;issue arrived. At the end of my second year and
              the beginning of my third year, grandfather started to
              teach me how to read. &nbsp;I would point to a
              picture&nbsp;and he would say the word and spell it.
              &nbsp;Then I would point and say the word and spell it.
              &nbsp;I was taught the alphabet and the numbers out of the
              pages of the NG. &nbsp;My second English teaching
              textbook, was one of his favorite authors (James Allen)
              book entitled "As A Man Thinketh". Grandfather had a
              fairly extensive library.</p>
            <p><strong>Well, back to Africa.</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">l finally out
                of the Kalahari Desert. The sand is out of my
                boots;&nbsp;not out of my mind. Like some women, the
                desert lingers on. The awesome proportions of this
                oversized "sandbox", dwarf ones' presence. As immensity
                embraces minuteness. Repeatedly, I stood speechless in
                the middle of this "nowhere".Yet in the middle of
                everywhere. As always words fade in the light of
                experience. This same feeling has brushed my soul in the
                past. Remembering back to standing at the railings of a
                twisting, tossing ship in the middle of both oceans and
                a number of seas. As I searched the depths of the murky
                mass that surrounded and miniaturized both ship and
                occupants. Or while sipping the heady wines of ecstasy,
                while perched on Hemingway's beloved Mt.
                Kilimanjaro..&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In these peak
                experiences "a la Maslow", the connective-ness, the
                unity of "all and everything"&nbsp;becomes the truth of
                the moment. During these&nbsp;momentary silences</span><span
                style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">.&nbsp;"Self-
                realization" was&nbsp;followed by a long overdue
                thanksgiving. For all the opulence, given by design.
                This Creation, we have been given contains within its'
                tapestry of design. A golden thread for those who can
                see it, this thread can lead one back to their origins,
                as to who and what</span><span style="font-family:
                Verdana, Arial;">&nbsp;they are. If they will make the
                conscious decision and effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As the
                shifting desert sands, rose and filled my footprints and
                hurried elsewhere. A voice told me; "to walk into the
                setting sun. And I would come upon a small village that
                would have water" (the liquid gold of the desert). Now,
                on this perpetual journey, I have been given all sorts
                of directions. Some very dubious, others amusing and
                then a few, very few correct ones. But when one is in
                the middle of a desert, in need of water. And a stranger
                riding a camel appears out of nowhere and announces;
                "Walk into the sun". You, question both his sanity and
                yours. The camels' state of mind, was never in question.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>The
                  Rest of the Story:</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The village
                was where it was supposed to be, as was the water.
                Again, I silently thanked my mysterious benefactor, who
                had disappeared as he had appeared. On entering the
                village, eyes widened, steps halted,&nbsp;voices became
                whispers. As the camel rider; I too, seemed&nbsp;to have
                materialized up out of the sands.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Since water
                had become a priority item, several miles back. I did my
                best imitation of a thirsty man in need of water. And a
                little girl about ten years of age brought me an earthen
                jar of water. After thanking her, which she did not
                understand I gave a slight bow, this she understood and
                did likewise. I popped two iodine tablets into the jar
                and slowly began to quench my much overdue thirst. About
                the same time a young man approached me and asked in
                broken phrases of English: "If I would have something to
                eat with he and his family." I accepted his gesture of
                hospitality with reservation, which I didn't reveal to
                him. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">During this
                trek of more than fifty countries and nearly ten years.
                I have had a variety of ethnic foods offered up to me in
                villages, towns and cities. A variety of fruits,
                berries, roots nuts and various questionable liquids.
                Delicacies of roasted flying termites, ants in honey,
                strange vertebrates, fish, and fowl.&nbsp;An assortment
                of animal meats: monkey, baboon, crocodiles, impala,
                snake, Cape Buffalo, plus others which I have
                conveniently forgotten their names. Plus names I can't
                pronounce. There were those times when my stomach
                questioned my powers of choice and rebelled. I have
                reached an unscientific conclusion. One has to be borne
                into a certain food cultures to fully appreciate the
                daily fare of the foods of the world. But for a
                Westerner there are some other considerations that
                affect ones' gastronomic delight. The hygienic
                conditions; food storage (meats left in the hot sun,
                with a variety of insects having a feast.) all sorts of
                contamination. All these can affect one's culinary
                appreciation or at least mine.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">One just has
                to see to believe and even then one asks themselves,
                whether they are seeing what they are seeing? To say
                that some of the conditions are primitive, does not say
                it all. But yet, it is primitive to us, but not to those
                who are living in the said conditions. To them it is
                just life. It is the way it is. There is a story that
                says it well;</span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">A riot had
                  broken loose, and a street rug-seller had acquired a
                  fine rug from one of the looters for a nominal fee.
                  And he started hawking his new possession. "One
                  hundred dinars, only one hundred dinars, for this
                  lovely rug." As he walked up and down the street.
                  Finally a friend came along and asked him; "why, are
                  you selling such a priceless rug for only "one
                  hundred" dinars?. The rug-seller replied; " "is there
                  anything more than one hundred"?</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Whether it be
                in Africa, or in some other part of the world. Many are
                like the rug dealer, a hundred is all there is. It is
                very difficult to stand outside your existence and see
                the reality of your own life. We are not only in it, we
                are of it and it of us. And of course this is a "no,
                no." A truth, a reality,&nbsp;that we are surely in the
                world, but the greater <strong>Truth</strong> is, <em><strong>we
                    are not of this world</strong></em>. We need to see
                ourselves for who we are and what we are? Not as we are,
                not as we are in our limitations. If we could observe
                ourselves, watch as an outside witness. Observing the
                observer, as a subject interacting with other subjects
                and objects. It is just possible that this type of being
                aware could help us to realize that one hundred is not
                all there is. That reality is what we make it, that one
                does not have to accept, that life only goes to a
                hundred. The mold can be broken! But to break the mold,
                we need to ask ourselves how is it, that we have come to
                believe in this limiting and confining approach to life?
                Why are we, so prone to look at life in such a narrowing
                way? How can we expand our horizons, our consciousness,
                so we can see <strong>reality</strong> as it is? Not,
                as we have been programmed to see.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>Back
                  to the story</strong>:</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I have said
                this in speaking to groups. That usually I sent up my
                tent as soon as possible and start the preparation of
                food. Partially in light of, the existing conditions
                which we have spoken about. And also because the people
                of the villages are quick to offer food, even when they
                themselves have so little. As one man apologized to me
                in a thatched hut community, saying; that he didn't have
                much, but he would be glad to share what he had. Which
                echoes the words; "Silver and gold, I have none. But
                what I do have, I will give". There have been those
                situations where they have offered me&nbsp; their
                children's food, in befriending me. It is not uncommon
                for children within a family to take turns in skipping
                meals, some eating ever other day. People with so little
                giving so much to a stranger can be very embarrassing.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">How often does
                one find this graciousness? Anglo to Anglo, not often.
                This is rare in the Western Hemisphere, in ratio. For
                peoples of the more populated areas, have a tendency to
                be more exclusive, clannish, or reticent. And less
                motivated to invite a stranger&nbsp;into their "comfort
                zones". This is not meant to be critical or derogatory,
                it is merely an observation. People have got to do, what
                people think they have to do. The extended hand has not
                as yet, become a universal trait. But it is gaining
                ground and someday; the cynics of the world will be a
                dying breed.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As I walk; I
                wonder, as I have done all my life. I wonder about those
                in the past who have walked the same path, road or
                direction. As I now walk, in the silence of their steps.
                What had been their thoughts, dreams and aspirations as
                they walked? Did they also ask of themselves, who and
                what they were, what they were to be about and where
                they were going?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Now I ask; is
                humankind any closer in answering these eternal
                questions now, than then? Or have we de-volved instead
                of evolved? As disturbing and frustrating, as this
                cyclic de-volution and evolution might be. This very
                falling and rising, this descending and ascending, this
                backward and forward dance of life, may seem to us as
                being to repetitive. But it is a necessity, it is
                integral, a prerequisite in the 'relative' connective
                schema of things. Or we could say that without these
                contrasting cycles, it would not be possible for us to
                become and be what we were created to be. Which in
                Reality we already are. A fact which we have forgotten</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This RETURN to
                that which we already are, must be a conscious knowing,
                one of decision and effort. as the knower;&nbsp;the
                knowing and the known become as one. To know and not
                know, you know, is but half of the equation. The other
                half is to know that you know, this is and can be a
                possibility. To repeat, there must be a de-scension
                before there can be any ascension. The above is the
                below, and the below is the above. They are one and the
                same "substance".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>Back
                  to the story:</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There is a
                wonderful strangeness, along with a prevailing awe and
                wonderment, that rises up out of the Deserts of the
                World. That meets each step, as the sand rushes to
                surround and engulf each step. They, the Deserts of the
                World are sisters in kind, especially their nights.
                Those unforgettable desert nights when the stars seem to
                be resting in the hollow of your hand. As you lie
                beneath the lacy canopy, whose very edges seem to reach
                out beyond the beyond. And you are privileged, to a
                breathless display of splendor that would strike dumb
                the most gifted poets and artists. We ask; are there any
                earthly words, paint or palette, that can begin to
                portray the matchless beauty of the desert nights in all
                their finery?&nbsp;I think I hear a resounding "No!"</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">After leaving
                Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; I turned my steps towards
                Francistown, Botswana to fulfill several speaking
                engagements, that had been prearranged. From
                Francistown, I headed towards Maun, which was
                approximately 427 miles, give or take a mile or two.
                With a full compliment of supplies, that rounded the
                backpack out at one hundred pounds. And yes, I have
                heard the expression; "strong back, weak mind." I am
                often asked, "How do you carry a hundred pounds?" Well
                you <strong>just do it.</strong> If for any reason you
                decide that you cannot do it. You will not be able to
                lift the backpack, let alone walk with it. Anyone who
                has ever pumped iron. Knows that as you slip underneath
                the weight to do a bench press. And you have told
                yourself, that you can do it. Chances are you will lift
                the weight. But if you convince yourself, you cannot do
                it Chances are, it will not happen. Even though your
                body strength is the same as it was the day before when
                you lifted the weight. The mind, body and spirit must be
                as one, when the "moment of truth" arrives. Here we are
                speaking about a state of attention, a centering, a
                focusing. <strong>Attending solely to the task at hand</strong>,
                a gathering together of all of ones' energies to do what
                must be done, at that particular time in space.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The 427 miles,
                took thirty days, with no complications. The first
                village I came to was Nata, which took approximately six
                days to reach, It was abut 117 miles from Francistown.
                The next four villages were fairly evenly spaced apart,
                all the way to Maun. As in most of the villages, towns
                or cities, I attract a fair share of curious onlookers.
                They are fascinated with the six foot staff which I
                carry plus the two customized machetes displayed on each
                side of my large red backpack. Along with a Twelve foot
                bullwhip and a large Bowie knife. Usually before I reach
                a village, a small entourage {mostly children of all
                ages} gather to follow me in. Many of the children,
                especially those of the Thatched Hut Communities, have
                never seen a white man walking their foot paths. As I
                enter these communities; their is a lot of grinning,
                smiling and hand gestures, the Universal language. If I
                say; " hello", they "hello" back and "hello", and
                "hello". This can go on throughout the day, or as long
                as you are there.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">While setting
                up my tent, I am never without an audience of curious
                eyes watching my every move. And as often is the case,
                before leaving the village. The young and old alike,
                want to see the bullwhip, the throwing "hawk " and
                throwing knives in action.. In some of the villages the
                men have spears and knives of their own. And then we
                have a little throwing competition. Somewhere, in all
                these goings on, I amuse the children by dislodging my
                dentures, moving them in and out. Many have never seen
                false teeth before.&nbsp;They are fascinated by the
                magic teeth. One day as I was entering a town in North
                Africa.&nbsp;I suddenly found myself surrounded by
                children. I couldn't move in any direction. And then I
                sneezed and my upper denture moved, peeking out between
                my lips. The children jump back as though, a shot had
                been fired. During their initial shock, I had taken a
                bandanna I had hanging on the side of my backpack and
                brushed my mouth quickly concealing the teeth in the
                folds of the bandanna. As they watched, I opened the
                bandanna, so they could see the teeth laying in the
                center of the handkerchief. As quickly as I had removed
                my teeth, I replaced them, with the bandanna hiding the
                movement. And then showed them the empty bandanna. They
                were convinced it was magic. They had never seen teeth
                like that before. They went and got their friends and
                anyone else they could find, to come and see the magic
                teeth. They followed me all around town, wanting to see
                the "teeth show".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">From that
                moment on, whenever I would find myself knee deep in
                children, it was denture time, it never failed me. I
                have had a number of amusing experiences along the way.
                And my dentures have played a part in many of them. One
                such time, as I was relating this story to a group of
                second graders. A little boy during the question and
                answer period wanted to know. If I had purchased my
                teeth at a Joke Shop.&nbsp;Could I wind them up and make
                them chatter. I told him, my teeth often chattered as I
                walked over mountains in the snow. That seem to satisfy
                his curiosity. At least I thought it did, but as I was
                about to leave The same little boy approached me. And
                asked; "How much did they charge you for your teeth?"</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In the final
                310 miles to Maun, I traveled through and skirted
                several game reserves, plus the Nam Pam National Park,
                just beyond Gweta. Since I am walking I am privy to have
                seen all the game in their natural habitat, out in the
                bush. Not behind an electric fence, riding in a Land
                Rover or some other tourist conveyance. Large fenced
                acreage for the animals, are replacing their natural
                environment to keep the poachers from killing them off.
                The endangered lists are growing in Africa. It is
                possible that in a couple of generations, many of the
                "big five"in Africa will be close to extinction. But the
                sad part of this scenario, is that the animals can no
                longer migrate from place to place, as has been their
                way of life, since the beginning. They were borne to be
                free.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In my walking,
                most of the animals I see are on the move, going from
                somewhere to somewhere. If they venture near, it is
                usually out of curiosity. Animals are basically wary of
                humans. Of course this can change immediately if the
                animal or animals feel in anyway threatened. Or should
                someone do something stupid; like a quick movement, or
                encroach while they are eating, or come to close to
                their young. Or disobey the cardinal rule don't panic
                and run. For then you become a prey to chase. And this
                is especially true with the feline species or any of the
                other predator species. As with the wild African dogs,
                with their Mickey Mouse ears, or the Hyenas. Also the
                Rhino, Elephants and the Cape Buffalo can be spooked.
                Again, if one moves, it must be in slow motion. Around
                animals one must expect the unexpected at all times. For
                these occasions I carry firecrackers an a good
                dependable Zippo lighter. They are very effective. The
                bull-whip I carry requires more movement to operate, so
                the firecrackers are the best choice.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">From Maun to
                Windhoek, Namibia the villages were spaced further apart
                which presented a little problem, as to my water supply.
                I carry two- half gallion containers. But where there is
                a will, there is a way. Two times I traded for some
                water from several water carriers. The barter I used was
                one of the oldest bartering substances in history,
                "salt". Before reaching Maun, I passed through the
                "Okavango Delta" and camped at Lake Nagame. If you are
                lucky, you will see some beautiful Lions But before
                reaching the lake, I had the rare privilege of seeing
                several families of the Pan tribe, Namibia's "bushmen".
                While camping in their camp, I saw several packs of the
                spotted African dogs. I left them alone and they left me
                alone. After that, it was on to Gobalis, Namibia.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Within the 527
                mile stretch between Francistown and Windhoek, there are
                hundreds&nbsp;of thatched roofed hut communities hidden
                in the bush. With their serpentine paths weaving in and
                out of their villages. Most of them are of the
                pre-Tarzan motif. They are much the same as during the
                Dr. Livingston era. It gives one that feeling of walking
                back in and through time. My words can not take you
                there. One has to see the primitive-ness of some of
                these communities. The sights and sounds, the tastes and
                smells need to become a part of ones'
                consciousness&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:
                Verdana, Arial;">and thought. And even more, the moment
                needs to be savored, breathed in. So that the "essence",
                the "is-ness" of the scene touches one's "I am-ness".</span><span
                style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is very, very
                difficult to equate all this, as we are about to enter
                into the 21st. century. It is very easy to say; " this
                just can't be," and yet it is. Believe me, when I say
                that this observation, is in no way an indictment on the
                peoples of these villages. If charges were to be
                brought, it would have to be brought and laid at the
                feet of those who have exploited Africa from within. As
                well as those who have done the same from without. The
                blame is humanity's blame, down through the years.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Even those who
                live in the larger towns and cities, who are several
                generations removed from this type of environment. Find
                it difficult to believe the living conditions of the
                bush communities. And as for the city children, the bush
                is like another world to them. Much as it would be for a
                New York city child to relate to a working cattle and
                horse ranch in Texas.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Post cards,
                documentaries, brochures, snapshots, CNN or the Tour
                guides' spiel can never portray the face of Africa. One
                must become and be a part of Africa. To better speak
                about the complexities of this vast land mass. But even
                then, the best witnesses of the real face of Africa.
                Would be those who were borne in Africa, and who have
                made the study of their homeland, their life's' work.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">To repeat
                myself, simply because it bears repeating. The living
                conditions in the greater majority of these hut
                communities would be inconceivable to the Western
                mind-set. Lives daily lived in sub-standard conditions,
                with little or no amenities which would cause even the
                hardest of hardened hearts to mummer. Conditions that
                daily affect the health of the inhabitants. One does not
                only see the physical maladies and the mark it leaves on
                the old and young, alike. But the signs of the poor in
                spirit is evident also. There are many emotional tugs
                of&nbsp;the heart strings of humanity. But none more
                poignant than the lives that are being played out in
                Africa, day by day.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In the
                thousands of hut villages that dot the landscape of
                Africa, there are hundreds of thousands&nbsp;of young
                boys and girls who will be denied the educational
                training needed; to enter the technological society of
                the twenty-first century. And at the rate the ruling
                Governments of most of these African countries are
                moving, in the solving of their infra-structuring
                problems. Three or four generations to come will also
                suffer the same scenario. Today's' generation is reaping
                the ineptness of their Government's apathy and
                indifference, to their plight.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">To many of
                these Governments have a "Janus Face". One side is for
                the benefit of the IMF, the World Bank, the United
                Nations, and the Governments of the Western World. The
                other half of the face, is what the people see and know,
                for those who can see and know.&nbsp;Meanwhile these
                Leaders and the interests they represent; friends,
                cronies and their own party members. Are becoming fat
                cats at the expense of their own people. When it comes
                right down to the nitty-gritty, most of these people who
                have been elected, do not have the know-how, to correct
                or to find a solution to the problems of their
                respective nations. And when they (the Governments) do
                get around to putting their finger in the dike. It is to
                little too late.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In walks
                greed, self-indulgence, corruption, and a misplaced
                loyalty to their party. Instead of their loyalty to
                their constituency. And then, there is that constant
                bickering and fighting; to get a bigger piece of the
                pie, <em><strong>and the people be dammed</strong></em>.
                The propaganda that many of these African countries give
                out, is worst than a shady tourist guide.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Case in point:
                The published literacy level of the education of these
                countries, may read 90-95 per cent, literacy. This is a
                guess, for the World to see. The census taking in most
                of these developing countries is inadequate. They have
                neither the facilities for accuracy, or the trained
                personnel. The questions asked of the householders are
                not understood, so any answer may be given by any one
                who might be opening the door. Literacy in most
                of&nbsp;these countries means, reading writing and
                arithmetic. Are there exceptions to this statement, of
                course, but not enough exceptions. In today's' World and
                especially in the World of the 21st. century. Reading
                writing and arithmetic, will not fuel the technology of
                tomorrow. A higher education is not in the cards for
                millions of African children. Now or even in the near
                future. How about the Leaders and the Politicians'
                children will they be educated. You betcha!, some in
                Britain, others in America. As they say in Africa; "No
                problem"!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Do the Leaders
                and the politicians want their people to be well
                educated? I seriously doubt it. Educated people are hard
                to control, very unpredictable. The uneducated can be
                misdirected and distracted by the politicians. So that
                the people cannot see what is really happening. Just
                throw them a bone now and then is the politicians' ploy.
                To keep them satisfied and pacified. And then promise
                them what they want to hear. What about the whites that
                were and are borne in these countries? Are they a plus
                or a minus, do they detract and add to the problems of
                Africa?. Or do they join in to help rectify the problem?
                Well, when you hear the words; "they", "them", and
                "those" and not "we." You have your answer. In most
                cases; it is them and those against we'ens. " Molly and
                me, and baby makes three", that's all there is.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Some of these
                countries have been at this job of running a country for
                a long time. And they still haven't got it right. When I
                was in Greece. There was a common saying. And it could
                well apply to the African leaders. The Greeks say;
                "Greeks are rich, but Greece is poor." Many of the
                leaders, politicians and the elite few in Africa, are
                the ruling class. Allowing their own kind to live in
                bondage. Will it change, yes! When? When the people rise
                up and say: "enough, is enough!" " We will no longer
                serve in bondage".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">So we ask, the
                question that needs to be asked. Until a solution is
                reached, will the future generations of the many
                developing countries be denied the educational
                opportunities, which the children of the Western
                societies, have taken for granted all these many years?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In the past,
                the youth of these developing countries have been denied
                the much needed educational opportunities. Through no
                fault of their own. In most cases, they have no recourse
                to change their impending destiny. As they become the
                disenfranchised. The World will as in the past, never
                know and receive, the possible potentialities of this
                lost legion of children, who are mostly invisible to the
                World-at-large. The question that needs to be ask; "Do
                the Movers and Shakers of the world really want to do
                something about this inequity, this injustice?" We can
                only hope and pray, that the history books of the future
                will record a "yes"!, they cared. Or that someone at
                least cared enough. To give these young people a chance
                to choose their future.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I have often
                wondered on this trek, if the people of the more
                developed countries ever appreciate the fact. That they
                were borne at a more propitious time, as opposed to
                being borne in the seemingly wrong place at the wrong
                time. Where the odds are stacked against the possible
                possibilities and potentialities that could or might
                have been.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There is no
                doubt that the problems of illiteracy, improper
                infra-structuring, shelter, clothing, a rising birth
                rate and the increasing insidious epidemic of H.I.V.,
                which has reached gargantuan proportions. Needs to be
                addressed; but when these things are put along side of
                one of the most unbelievable problems of our
                technological age. They pale in comparison.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We are talking
                about food in-security, the scarcity of food which
                contributes to the death of 40,000 innocent children per
                month. Can you imagine, if 40,000 children were put
                inside of a Football Stadium. And were not given food
                until they died of starvation? And this was on our
                nightly news casts all over the world, just for one
                night. Can you imagine, the hue and cry, by all of
                humanity? It would reach the outer edges of space. Those
                responsible would pay. And a solution would be found,
                "chop,chop".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This
                starvation and dying, is a monstrous absurdity,
                especially in the face of today's technology. Not only
                are we not solving this starvation holocaust. We are
                compounding the problem by our instruments of mass
                destruction. This figure of 40,000 is believed to be a
                conservative estimate There are no words in any of the
                human languages on the face of this earth, that can
                describe this insanity and irrationality on the part of
                our World leaders. Those who are entrusted with the
                welfare of the peoples of their respective countries.
                Those very ones who supposedly, have the wisdom and the
                power to deal with the sicknesses of our World. We are
                talking about those, who by all intent and purpose were
                and are intrusted to serve in the best interest of their
                peoples. And it is these very same leaders, who are
                unable to say; "enough is enough !." And to just stop
                talking about it. And do that which is necessary, to
                stop this insanity, this ongoing carnage. It makes one
                wonder, if we have the best of the best in leadership
                roles throughout the world?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We beat our
                chests and wail about the ethnic cleansing and the
                killing fields. We hear the exhortations, to remember
                The Holocaust, the Bosnia and Kosovo nightmares. Or
                Rwanda, with the Tusi and the Hutu blood-baths and the
                Algerian butchery. What about the half-million children
                dying of starvation each year, who cries for them. One
                has to wonder why those responsible for setting the
                media policy, do not take the same pains, the same
                effort and skill. That they so diligently use, when they
                make the policy regarding the coverage on the dying
                thousands via the Civil and the National wars that fill
                our newsprint and airways on a daily basis. Why can't
                they write a policy and speak with the same verve and
                passion about the 500,000 dying children each year. That
                will never breath the air or feel the sun on their
                faces, as they run and play. Herein lies the makings of
                a series of Pulitzer Prize articles.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We hear about
                all the deaths caused by AIDS. The need for a cure, a
                vaccine. And we know that researchers the World over are
                pressing for a break through. The price tag is already
                into the Billions. But what about the deaths among the
                just borne and the young. Not counting the older ones
                who are also dying of mal-nutrition. We have the
                knowledge, and the technology, to stop the existing
                hunger of the World. We don't have to discover a
                vaccine. We have to discover;&nbsp;to find our hearts,
                our compassion, our charity again. Maybe if they
                rewarded huge dividends, or a big payoff. Like, that
                which happens when a vaccine or a drug is discovered,
                and marketed. The cure for the hunger of the starving,
                might just become a fashionable fad, the thing to do.
                And eventually World Hunger would become a thing of the
                past, like smallpox.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We desperately
                need to flesh out, to put faces to all the numbers that
                are gathered by the statisticians Which are used over
                and over again. In all the rhetorical speeches, that
                flow so effortlessly from the lips of the higher
                echelon. That also appear in all the countless documents
                and memos. That have become part of the language of the
                endless repetitive gatherings of the professional
                Leaders of Nations, of Industry, of Commerce and
                Finance. Those, that "play ring around" the Worlds'
                suffering masses in body, mind and spirit. As they
                continue to bounce around those tired dog-eared,
                familiar buzz words. At the many costly Inter-national,
                one-up-man-ship games of the World. Those thread-barren
                tattered words of hunger, death, poverty, illiteracy,
                unemployment, child labor and abuse, human rights,
                injustice, inequality and on and on, and on. But I guess
                to be fair. How could you have a meeting and rationalize
                all the goings' on, without these words that our spoken
                in such "hallowed" tones.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We know, but
                we conveniently ignore the fact. That there are millions
                going to bed each night without food. And that the water
                they drank, if they can find it, is unsanitary and that
                is an understatement. That death and pestilence awaits
                them. Today, tomorrow and who knows how much longer.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The existing
                sanitary conditions that millions live in and endure
                daily. Are conditions which we would not even let our
                Western "cats and dogs" live in. And while we are on the
                subject of dogs and cats. Which is more important,
                saving the lives of&nbsp;our dogs and cats, or the lives
                of 500,000 children per year? If everybody donated the
                price of three cans of dog or cat food, per day. How
                many lives would that save? Is a couple of cans of
                animal food worth a human life? Do I hear some; "No's?"</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><em>Note:</em>
                We spend 17 billion, per year on dog and cat food, 12
                billion on ice cream and 8 billion on cosmetics.
                Something is wrong somewhere!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Some children
                eat every other day, if they are lucky. What they do eat
                is sub-standard, it falls far short of any thing close
                to proper nutrition. Many of the children have but a
                piece of bread, stale bread at that. Or bread out of a
                dumpsite or found in a garbage bag thrown out on the
                side of the road. Or if they are really lucky, they have
                a stick of sugar cane, or a piece of cloth dipped in a
                weak broth of some indistinguishable origin, that they
                suck on. Their eyes are sunken, their bellies swollen
                and they have those match stick bones, that are trying
                to work there way through the skin. And then we have
                those bodies which are covered with every imaginable
                sore you could think of. They make "Job" look like a
                piker. As has been said; one would have to see it, to
                believe it. And then you wish you hadn't seen it.
                Because it is beyond belief that this can exists on such
                a nightmarish scale. In a World, that is trying to
                conquer space and other worlds. While far to many are
                suffering in this World. Again we ask, is there not
                something, illogical, something missing in our
                fragmentary thinking? What a strange turn of the mind,
                we have at times.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I can still
                remember the words of my mother, when I was the age of
                some of these children, I have seen in the villages. Who
                look like death warmed over. She would say: "Eat your
                food, don't you know there are children starving in
                Africa. They would love to have your food." One time,
                after she had delivered her famous speech on the
                starving children in Africa. I said; "Is there anyway,
                we can mail this spinach to them. I'll even pitch in a
                few peas and carrots." Needless to say, I was sent to my
                room. Well at least I didn't have to eat the spinach.
                That was sixty-two years ago. And the children in Africa
                and other parts of the World are still starving and
                dying. And we ask, how can this still be so? As we are
                getting ready to move into the 21st century.&nbsp;Into
                Space to answer some of our questions, about out there?
                But what about some of our "now" questions, here on
                earth? What say we about the dying children, in a
                high-tech world? A World that could fed, clothe, shelter
                and educate all the children in need. Why do we penalize
                them. They were not asked if they wanted to come into a
                World which doesn't care if they live or die. In fact,
                we even have those who say; "good" the world is to
                crowded anyway. To bad that we cannot "zap" these idiots
                into one of these starving villages in Africa. So they
                can live out their existence there.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There are no
                quick easy simplistic solutions. But this problem has
                been with us to long. To long for us not to have a
                better track record than we have. We have a moral
                responsibility, when children become the victims, of our
                man made systems that spawn injustices and inequality.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As to the
                African plight; the causes and the effects are
                multifaceted. We could sight; illiteracy, unemployment,
                poor infra-structuring, tribal-ism, past colonialism,
                despotism and cronyism. Along with the greed and the
                corruption from on high down to the low. And the ever
                present exploitation by the many of those inside and
                outside of Africa.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And then there
                is that age old, cause and effect, the existing attitude
                of prejudices. That reduces everybody, both the
                victimizer and the victim into being sub-human. Any
                peoples who de-self and de-face others, in turn do it to
                themselves. Any and all that take part in this
                dehumanizing process. Are guilty and stand accused
                whether they be white, black or polka-dot. If we think
                that people need to be passed on, approved of, as in
                regards to their race, color, or creed. We should go to
                the blackboard and write. "We are family," one thousand
                times.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><em>It

                  none to throw. </em></span></p>

                up out of the desert, the city of Windhoek, Namibia,
                rises up from out the sands with it's trendy shops,
                Hotels, Restaurants and a modern Shopping Mall. With a
                Western architectural influence. The City seems almost
                out of place in comparison with all the villages with
                their mix and match motifs (of plastic, cardboard,
                corrugated tin and a wide assortment of this and that.)
                Along with their make shift utilities. All this you can
                see, within a stones throw from the center of the city.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The residents
                of the city have successfully formed an "Anglo island,"
                which conveniently separates the villagers from the
                elite and the middle class. The greater majority of the
                services and the imported consumer products are from
                South Africa, Europe and the States. But most of these
                are beyond the means and the reach of the outsider, who
                lives in the villages. Many of the out-landers walk
                great distances to come into town to get their staples,
                so their families can be fed. As do many of the
                domestics, that walk back and forth.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Many of the
                whites would not admit, that there is a subtle and
                sometimes not even a subtle, exiting "caste system", an
                unspoken class distinction within the city of Windhoek,
                as well as in most of the African countries. But as we
                know most of the World, suffers in one way or another
                from this sort of snobbery, this malady of exploiting
                others. Some places are worst than others. But the sad
                commentary of this practice; is that in many cases, the
                ways and means used to accomplish this de-humanizing,
                this de-facing and de-selfing of humanity. Is wrapped in
                the guise of tradition, custom and sorry to say,
                religion, to give it respectability. The quote of the
                day, month or year. "What I pay them, is better than
                what they would get begging. They ought to be grateful
                to me for giving them a job."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">After arriving
                in Windhoek, I was directed to a new Backpackers' Inn
                that was just about to open, called "Tuckers'".
                Strangely enough, it had formally been called the
                Globe-Trotters Inn. I say strange, because that was the
                name of the first backpackers' place, where I stayed
                when I arrived in Dublin, Ireland on March 16, 1992 to
                take on the rest of the "World Walk". The new owners of
                the new establishment; Red and Stan graciously received
                me. And made me part of their opening fanfare. From this
                fanfare, speaking engagements were forth-coming. As were
                other invitations. Stan and Red graciously refused
                payment for the room. The room had all the amenities,
                air conditioning, shower bath, a large desk which was
                moved in for my use. In their Bar and Lounge area, they
                had a special satellite large screen for viewing sports.
                How sweet it was, with the Super bowl just around the
                corner. And I must not forget, the jumping, swinging,
                honkey-tonk "Cowboy Bar", next door. With "swing your
                partner and dosey doe", every night.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Since the
                beginning of this "World Wide Trek". I have not missed a
                "Super Bowl" in the last nine years. While I was walking
                the fifty states, come Super Bowl time, this "happy
                camper" found a television set to watch the game. The
                first "Super Bowl" I watched overseas was in a Hotel
                lobby, in Algercias, Spain. The second one in Prague,
                Czech Republic. The third was in Jerusalem, the fourth
                in Nairobi, Kenya. The fifth in Windhoek, Namibia, the
                sixth in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. It is hard to believe that
                I have been watching the "Super Bowl" for thirty one
                years, since 1967. When the Green Bay Packers beat the
                Kansas City Chiefs in Super bowl One. Bart Starr
                quarterbacked the Packers and Len Dawson quarterbacked
                the Chiefs.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>Back
                  to the African Story</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Before leaving
                Africa, I will be closing in on, 46,000 miles, give or
                take a mile here or there. Which adds up to about seven
                years of walking and two an half years of R&amp;R,
                involving all the pleasures of the senses, via
                sight-seeing the wonders of the World. And smelling the
                roses along the way in all the cities, towns and
                villages. During these breather periods in the cities, I
                return back to a more gregarious setting, a different
                pace and rhythm of events, people and relationships. As
                opposed to experiencing the primal rhythms of the land,
                and the peoples of the land plus&nbsp;the realities of
                both. Each setting has its' moments, but I must confess,
                the journey far exceeds the intermittent destinations.
                Destinations must not become a period, they should at
                best become but a comma. A momentary pause, a fleeting
                respite along the path. For should one succumb to the
                subtleties of stopping ones' pilgrimage, in turn for a
                state of permanency and its' illusions. One could
                quickly turn into a pillar of inertia which can bring
                with it; boredom, apathy, indifference and an odor of
                decay and in some cases, even death.&nbsp;Chances are we
                also may or can forfeit our return back, if we choose
                this inertia.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is
                observable in the high density areas, where the name of
                the game is the acquisition of things under the guise of
                need. Where the true motivation in many cases stems from
                a need to be accepted, or conferring one with a sense of
                status, or for some this&nbsp;acquisition gives them an
                identify, which they seem to be lacking. In this
                acquisition game, there lies in wait the possibilities
                of both stress and anxiety. As the game players settle
                into their "quiet desperation." amid their comfort
                zones. With their juggling of quantity and quality, real
                wants and needs as opposed to the lesser wants and
                needs. Along with their inner and outer conflicts. Let's
                face it, our lack of happiness, is not due to something
                outside ourselves. Our problems and our reoccurring
                problems lie within our fragmentary lifestyles and our
                fragmentary thinking. We are not whole, we are pieces of
                this and that. We have partial glimpses of reality and
                especially, a partial knowledge of who and what we are?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">On this
                journey, I find myself in the midst of so many gifts and
                graces, incessant sensory inputs and impressions that
                surface and circulate on all levels of my well-being.
                Many insights and nuggets of wisdom, along with those
                spontaneous challenges that have expanded my
                consciousness levels; my self knowledge and
                understanding. Not only of self but of the world at
                large. Along with the truth of our unitive
                connective-ness with "all and everything". That comes
                out of "<b>All and Everything</b>", the "<b>All in All</b>".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I am not quite
                sure of the extant of my original expectations at the
                beginning of this pilgrimage. But I am sure that
                whatever they were, they have been greatly exceeded.
                There is no conceivable way, in ones' wildest of
                imaginations, to predetermine all the impressions,
                input, happenings, and events when we move out from the
                safety of our comfort zones into new surroundings, new
                circumstances and new relationships. And in this new
                time and space, if we will keep our eyes and ears
                focused and open, along with an open mind, heart and
                spirit. As we breathe in the newness and freshness of
                each new "Now". Our lives&nbsp;become transformed before
                our very eyes. You can take that to the bank.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">But if one
                insists on hanging on, to what used to be. On to ones'
                old hang-ups and negative ways. One&nbsp;can rest
                assured that when we look into the mirror again, staring
                back at us will be the old image, not the new one. We
                need to hear with our eyes and see with our
                ears.&nbsp;As we look and listen, we need to see and
                hear, cut down on the thinking, the chattering, the
                speculating, and all our theorizing. While we are seeing
                and hearing, forget the past (don't dragged it into the
                present) nor (drag the future into the present either).
                Let the present, the "Now" be the present, the "Is-ness"
                of the moment. On its' own merit, unencumbered without
                some hidden agenda or baggage of any kind.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Throughout my
                life, I have been privileged to have fleeting glimpses
                of insight as to my direction and as to why that
                particular direction. Which in turn has increased my
                awareness. I have always been the observer, watching the
                observer. And asking why do I think and act as I do? Why
                do all of us think and act as we do?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There are many
                answers and reasons as to why. It would help in our
                lives if we would investigate these reasons and gain
                some self-knowledge and self-understanding as to the
                history of how our minds and brains have been structured
                and programmed. Not just from out of our own past. But
                how humanity's past, up to now, has affected and still
                does affects our way of thinking and doing. In every
                area of our lives, at all levels of our mind, heart and
                spirit. We are connected and we have always been
                connected.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">My, how I do
                carry on, in my advancing years. It must be the spell of
                Africa.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">My walk
                through Africa will no doubt be one of my most
                unforgettable experiences. What these eyes of mine have
                recorded, my ears heard and my spirit felt, have left
                their mark, their impressions, their very essence. I
                will never be the same for it. What a legacy, what a
                rare gift indeed. Many of my African moments have gone
                beyond the conceivable, entering into the realm of the
                unimaginable and the unexpected.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Who can tell
                the African story as it really is. The "whole truth and
                nothing but the truth". As I wrote in the fly leaf of my
                first journal nine and half years ago. "Words not only
                reveal the truth, they can conceal it even better ". I
                have heard many of the voices of Africa. The out pouring
                of the outraged, the cries of the weary, the oppressed,
                the lost and the disenfranchised. The faint mummers of
                the starved and the diseased. And then we add into this
                mix. All the mellifluous rhetorical speeches of those
                Pretenders to power. And their "yes" men, those polished
                political puppets, who mouth the words of the Pretender.
                Refusing, to be that which they speak. Let us not forget
                those other saccharine speakers; the intelligentsia, and
                the Governments' "spin" experts, the news commentators
                and analysts. That speak the party line.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As we enter
                the 21st. century, with the Globe shrinking in front of
                us. We as members of the Human Race would be amiss to
                believe that Africa's problems are only her problems.
                Their problems and all the other problems of the World.
                Are humanity's problems. Until we can come to
                understand; that we are family, that we are connected,
                that we share the same heritage as a family.
                Irrespective of what we call ourselves, of our cultures,
                our traditions, our religions, our way of thinking and
                doing. Our heritage is not one of separation, but one of
                unity, cohesiveness, a togetherness. Divided, we will
                continue to suffer and have pain. Continue to have
                conflict and continue to be lost and confused. We cannot
                speak as though Africa is&nbsp;her dilemma, all by
                herself. That she and she alone is the only cause for
                her now existing problems. We of this World, our World,
                with all of our past human history and now with our
                present thinking and actions, are &nbsp;responsible;
                when ever there is a problem within the human matrix.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We are far
                beyond any policy of isolationism. We all breathe the
                same air, we all have the same blood flowing through our
                veins [in a general sense], all have been given the same
                basic intelligence, the same physical and psychological
                attributes. The same basic needs; shelter, clothing and
                food. To be loved and respected, to belong and to be
                accepted, to be a part of. And in today's' World, we
                should &nbsp;have a choice, an equal opportunity to be
                educated regardless of gender, race or creed.
                Also&nbsp;an equal opportunity to work and receive a
                fair days pay for a fair days work. Lastly,&nbsp;the
                most important. The right to be free:&nbsp;to choose and
                speak, without fear of censure or reprisal.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We, and the
                forefathers of our past generations are guilty of being
                the progenitors of the conflicts, the confusion and of
                the many social ills that exist in our World today. We
                need to underline those last two words, "Our World". We
                are in this "given" World and consequently; we are the
                "Care-takers", all of humanity are the caretakers, for
                we are family. We are of <em><strong>one race, the
                    human race</strong></em>. All of us, are in the
                image, the reflection of the "One," of <strong>That</strong>
                which just "<strong>Is</strong>" Choose your
                semantics.&nbsp;Should you be of another position
                another preference, per chance. Believing that their is
                no purpose in "Being," "who and what you are". That one
                just comes and goes and that's life. That there is no
                rhyme or reason; no design, no order. That chaos is the
                agenda for the day and all the days that follow; have at
                it. As they do say; "Different scenes for different
                genes" or "different strokes for different folks"; said
                the lady as she kissed the pig."</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Where were
                we?, yes. The immensity of this Continent and the
                eclectic nature of its' people defies description
                whether by speech, film or print. An outsider, whether
                myself or someone else, cannot tell the story of Africa,
                as it should be told. Even the indigenous speakers are
                hard put to portray their own countries in light of the
                World as it is today, with all its' complexities. If for
                no other reason this Continent is no longer isolated.
                And it must be seen and heard, not only because of its'
                vast potential, in both its' human and natural
                resources. But more importantly; Africa is part of the
                Human Global Village. It is part of the "Family" of the
                human race.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The peoples of
                Africa suddenly find themselves thrust onto the Worlds'
                stage. In the midst of all the World players. The rest
                of the World is beginning to see and hear, Africa's

                and the rest of the World Family, needs to take a
                serious, conscientious look at themselves; if the
                problems of Africa are to come to an end. And this holds
                true for all of our Worlds' problems. The answers lie
                within the problem, or to put it more succinctly; we,
                humankind are and have been the problem since the
                beginning of civilization. We have and are, continually
                compounding the problems; partially because we haven't
                the foggiest notion about; "why we are here?", "who or
                what we are". "Where we are going?" In most cases; the
                words" who gives a "tinker's damn, anyway!" Rings loud
                and clear. As the old prospectors used to say; "I am
                going to get it, while the getting is good. I'll beg,
                borrow or steal, if I have to. But I am going to get
                it". There is nothing more dangerous to the human race
                than gold fever ("<strong>Greed</strong>") All this
                getting, down through the eons of time. Has got us into
                the mess, that we as the human race are in at the
                present. And unless we start turning things around. We
                will continue to live amid our disorder.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Are there
                other reasons, "yes" many. But the <strong>truth is</strong>,
                we are at the bottom of all the extenuating
                circumstances and reasons. How we have thought in the
                past and think "now;" our thoughts, our words, our
                actions. Our perceptions of the past and "now", how we
                constructed and are constructing reality in our own
                image. How we seen ourselves, the peoples of the World
                and the things of the World, in our past and "now." All
                these have contributed to both the Worlds' and our own
                lost-ness, our sorrow and pain. As we have said
                recently. We are, <strong>all</strong> are, the
                inheritors of all the accumulative past. We have been
                spoon fed by our ignorance, programmed if you will. Down
                through the ages; we accepted the unreal for the <strong>Real</strong>,
                the untruths for the <strong>Truth</strong> and the
                darkness for the <strong>Light</strong>. In many cases,
                we have accepted without any investigation, while
                forsaking our given intelligence. Some of the most
                outlandish statements and concepts the world has even
                known. Has in turn blocked the needed truth. The reality
                of things as they are. During this dullness, we denied
                even our most basic common sense and reason. The list is
                great; (the misguided pre-suppositions, fanciful
                speculations, faulty perceptions, myths and
                superstitions, etc.) down through centuries. Causing
                undue misery and sorrow. Leaving behind a residue of
                chaos and utter confusion for each sequential, incoming
                generation. Two of the better asinine statements were;
                "The earth is flat. And it, (earth) is also, the center
                of the universe".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Let's see; we
                have had our Medieval Crusades, our Religious
                Inquisitions, our Witch Hunts, our Holocausts, our
                Ethnic Cleansing, Two World Wars, along with countless
                Civil and National Insurrections, all in the name of
                reason and sanity. And in some cases in the name of
                Religion. How great, our legacies? "As one thinks, so
                they are." And we also are, in a sense the progenitors
                of the now, the legacy givers. Since this is so; we need
                to re-present a different orientation for the future
                generation, for those which follow after. One that is
                not fragmented, one that is more whole. As is said; "we,
                each of us, have got to get it together"..."<strong>all</strong>"
                of it together. The totality of "all and everything".
                How? Well, this turns out to be the Sixty-Four-thousand
                dollar question?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Mankind has
                been struggling with this question, for...pick a time, a
                million years, how about 50,000 years? And we still
                haven't got it together, we are still fragmented, lost
                and disordered. Misery, sorrow, hurt and pain roam the
                face of the earth, looking for it's victims. And we have
                and are still looking for the enemy, the culprit which
                is responsible for all the ills that have and still do
                create unrest and disorder throughout the land and
                within the spirit {the essence) of all created things.
                Is the enemy; them and those? Is it over there, in front
                or behind us? "<strong>No, I saw the enemy and it was I</strong>".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>Back
                  to Africa:</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">To understand
                Africa's cultural diversity and its' pluralism, one
                would have to be in and of Africa and its past. Out of
                all the sights and sounds, this writer has been privy
                to, a witness to, an observer of, during this trek
                through Africa. Which has covered Morocco, Algeria to
                Tunisia. Then eventually from South Sinai to Cairo, to
                Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
                Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. There seems to be a
                pervasive trait that all African blacks hold in common.
                That being; an indomitable will to survive under the
                most, the starkest, abject conditions imaginable.
                Conditions of poverty, illiteracy, epidemics, civil
                strife, ethnic cleansing, et cetera. Along with an
                increasing population explosion, complicated by the
                rampant rise in H.I.V. Then there is always that
                devastating greed factor perpetuated by some of the
                whites and the elite blacks. Along with the Western
                Worlds' intervention via the World Bank and the
                International Money Fund that have reached a point of
                overkill. Case in point: Zimbabwe lays out one billion
                per month, for interest payments on borrowed moneys.
                Most of the newly formed nations are debt burden. And
                they practice the "rob Peter to pay Paul" method of
                payment Loans to pay loans, or rather to pay interest
                payments. It is a never ending cycle. Here the cure
                becomes worst than the disease.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">If one was
                looking for a catalogue of inequalities and injustices,
                they can be found woven into the fabric of Africa, part
                of so many lives, so many tears and sorrows, misery and
                sufferings. Because of this; so many wake up to and lie
                down; come nightfall with a heaviness of heart.. All the
                freedoms that we in the Western World take so much for
                granted. Are non-existent for millions across the width
                and breadth of Africa. They are bounded, gagged,
                fettered and restricted by their own leaders. Who have
                set themselves high above their own people. These same
                leaders have learned the art of deception and clothe it
                in a rhetorical cloth of many colors; designed to
                placate the masses and impress the International
                Community, as the leaders feast and line their pockets.
                Corruption has become a fine art, practiced by all those
                who have the inside track so to speak. But what makes it
                even worse, is the daily denial by the Elite, who
                profess that their hands are clean of any wrong doing.
                That they are being maligned and accused falsely. The
                word is out;" get all you can, while you can. For
                tomorrow's "coup de' gras", could be for you."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There is a
                need for an impartial assessment of Africa's' cultural
                differences, their historical values and their diverse
                ways of life, without any immediate condemnation or
                judgment. While at the same time the West needs to
                examine their motives and their responsibilities to
                Africa. And this is true for any of the other developing
                countries of the present. There is a need to question
                ourselves and ask; if our taking is exceeding our
                giving? And what is it, that we are giving. Is it that
                which will enhance and promote growth. Or will it hinder
                growth over the long haul. What are the motivations
                involved in our helping? We need to ask; "Is the dog
                wagging the tail or is the tail wagging the dog?"</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Africa must be
                allowed all the necessary growing pains it takes in its'
                evolutionary process. The crawl, walk and run stages are
                necessary in all the developmental structures. To
                abandon, or to skip over a needed stage, within the
                triad (crawl, walk, run) usually causes problems at a
                later date.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">But to
                parallel with the above; all the experience, wisdom and
                know how, that is relevant, to Africa's' growth and
                development needs. Should be offered by those whose
                motives are above personal gain and exploitation. It is
                one thing to give, it is quite another thing to expect a
                return on the gift. Expectation on the part of the
                giver, is death, for the relationship. The growth and
                the evolution of <strong>any</strong> relationship asks
                of the parties concern to bring something to the table
                that will help in the nurturing and growth of each of
                the parties in the relationship. This is a core element
                for any ongoing relationship. In whatever form
                (personal, societal, national or international).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As a parent
                should not suffocate or over protect, or create a
                co-dependency. Or dictate out of their deficiencies and
                weakness, or their self-serving needs in the nurturing
                of their children. The same is true in the nurturing of
                a nation and its' people as related to the country's'
                growth and evolution.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Let's carry
                this analogy a bit further. The nurturing of a child is
                predicated or needs to be predicated on the total
                welfare of the child. As to what is the best, the better
                or the more excellent for their growth and evolution.
                What are the most conducive condition for their journey
                from the cradle to the grave? We need to ask; how can
                the child best be nurtured? What means, ways and
                instruments can affirm, motivate, energize, engender and
                challenge the child's' latent talents and gifts. To be
                the best they can be? So they can affirm and celebrate,
                who and what they are?, why they are here and where are
                they going? So they might come to know how they fit into
                this unitive system, they were borne into. And how they
                might contribute to this connective-ness, they have with
                "all and everything."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And the last
                question; Who or what are the best catalysts or
                facilitators for the nurturing, for the growth and
                evolution, for the whole child. So that he or she might
                live in balance and harmony with "all and everything"
                and especially with themselves.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We can make
                this analogy applicable in many ways. Just by
                substituting the words; adult en-lighten-ment, community
                awareness, an emerging Government, or a Nation. In place
                of the words; "the nurturing of a child." This process
                of which we speak is not a maybe process, or a
                "catch-as-you-catch can" method, or a now and then
                procedure. It demands a focused attention, a focused
                discipline and a resolve to choose a methodology which
                is the most conducive to bring about fruition. If the
                results are poor, non-productive or of little substance.
                Then the process is faulty, as is the application.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">If in this
                process of seeking out the best, the better or the more
                excellent way to achieve maximum growth and evolution,
                is ignored. Or should someone be foolish enough to
                believe that they can by-pass or shorten the
                developmental stages, without being focused, disciplined
                and determined. The consequences can be far reaching and
                repetitive all the way to the grave. We end this analogy
                in saying; whether it be an individual, a parent, a
                teacher, a leader, a Government, an institution, or a
                Nation. These words need to be heard; "<strong>To those
                  who have been given much, much is expected of them</strong>".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">As I walk
                across this sleeping/waking giant of Africa. I am always
                struck by the child-like simplicity of the villagers and
                their spontaneous generosity, mixed with their
                delightful curiosity. Unhampered by the bias
                temperament, so often displayed by the Westerner. I have
                said so often during interviews and speaking
                engagements; the peoples of the world by in large are
                most generous and hospitable. Most of the problems, I
                have had during this trek stem from a variety of
                political and religious posturing. Mixed with anger and
                frustration brought on by a social content of want and
                starvation, illiteracy and unemployment</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In speaking to
                students and also to the business and professional
                organizations on both sides of the oceans. I have asked
                the same question of them. "How many people out of the
                seven&nbsp;billion plus, that inhabit this terrestrial
                space ship would you guess to be of a criminal or of a
                deviant nature? In that they would maim, injure or kill
                another human being, for little or no reason. I have
                heard thousands of replies; ranging from a half a
                million to a half a billion. I believe a half a billion
                is to high.&nbsp;Regardless of the media's blitz, in
                portraying violence. Most people are just trying to make
                ends meet and get on with their lives, the best they
                can. Is it not strange that we have so many
                "henny-pennys, who believe "the sky is always falling."
                Along with the gloom and doom people who walk around
                with their little cloud, waiting to rain all over some
                one, who is unfortunate enough to be in their presence.
                Most of these gloom characters spend most of their
                time,&nbsp;seeing only the negative aspects of life.
                They see neither the color of joy or hear the sound of
                music, that life is re-presenting ever moment for them,
                for all of us. We have allowed ourselves to become blind
                and deaf. What a shame!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We have hinted
                at the media's role in magnifying the dark side while
                paying little or no attention, to the sunny-side of the
                street. If we were to believe the media's
                hype.&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of the religious exhortations,
                "the world is going to hell in a hand basket". "That
                evil rules the day." How utterly absurd! For
                those,&nbsp;who seem to enjoy the shadow-lands, I
                pity.them, &nbsp;Such a waste of energy,&nbsp;a way to
                go through life.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Its'.&nbsp;amusing,

                that according to a minority group. You have to watch
                out for the faceless ones. They, them and those. But
                they, them and those are saying the same thing about the
                first, they, them and those. It gets a little confusing
                with all the; they, them and thoses. I wonder if a song
                could be written about this? &nbsp;As the saying goes;
                "what or who we don't know, we sometimes fear"? If this
                is true for us, if our fears our faceless and at times,
                nameless we need to confront them and find out. Who and
                what they are and come to terms with them and walk away?
                Never to fear them again. We need to stop breathing life
                into&nbsp;things that try to take life away from us.
                Those things that deplete our energies, that give us the
                "blahs". We need to take a stand. &nbsp;Enough is
                enough!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">&nbsp;An
                inwardly shout; "Here I stand. I was not created to
                shrink into the shadows. "I am", the expressed image of
                the <strong>Creative Will</strong>, the <strong>Force</strong>,
                the <strong>Spirit of All and Everything</strong>. I
                will not relinquish or bow to my lesser instincts. For I
                was created to stand in the Light not the dark".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>A Side
                  Note</strong> <br>
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Most of our
                fears,&nbsp;our overworked anxieties, doubts, conflicts,
                etc..Are self-induced; all part of our fragmentary
                thinking, consciousness and mind. We lack the
                self-knowledge,the self-understanding and certainty, of
                who and what we are. In light of this and some other
                factors, which we do not have the time to go into at the
                moment. We allow ourselves and our fears to diminish our
                lives, curtail our awareness and suffocate our
                alive-ness. As one of our Presidents said, a long time
                ago;"The only fear we have to fear, is fear itself."
                &nbsp;We blow to many things, out of proportion. Wasting
                a lot of &nbsp;energy. Making a mountain out of a
                molehill.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">One of the
                favored questions I am asked, in speaking&nbsp;about the
                journey. &nbsp;Do I have a fear for my life? Do I worry
                about being robbed or attacked by the wild animals in
                the bush? Only fleetingly, when imminent danger
                unexpectedly arises. But&nbsp;at that moment, one must
                learn how to master whatever comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
                hold it in check, so one can act and do that which is
                called for when a specific situation appears. &nbsp;If
                one should panic or become paralyzed. It might be to
                late.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">In
                &nbsp;my&nbsp;ten years of wandering in and out of the
                cities, towns, and villages of the World. Over
                mountains, through deserts and jungles. In and out of
                the wrong places at the wrong times. The risks are
                there, as are the potential dangers. If for no other
                reason than the random odds of becoming sick, or having
                an accident or some other unfortunate happenstance.
                One&nbsp;cannot live in fear, life is to precious. There
                are so many things to see, hear and be in the flow of
                life.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I remember
                after leaving Belfast, Ireland and entering Scotland. I
                picked up a newspaper and read about and account of an
                IRA ambush in Belfast. Where a British soldier was
                gunned down, along with a lady who was unfortunate
                enough to be coming out of small grocery store. Just
                three days prior to the shooting. I was in that same
                grocery store. &nbsp;I had stopped there frequently on
                my way back to the Hostel where I was staying. Or while
                being in Jerusalem; there was a certain bus stop where I
                would stand to catch the bus back to Bethlehem. One day
                at the precise time and the same spot where I had been
                standing just the day before. Twenty Israel soldiers and
                four civilians were killed by a bomb carrying Islamic
                fundamentalist (Jihad) who was also killed. Both of
                these just happened on a random basis.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Unfortunately
                there have been those "fight or flight" choices on this
                sojourn. But only seven of these incidents have surfaced
                which is minimal for 4,380 plus days of exposure. Which
                speaks highly to those who would have us to believe that
                the human race is more animal than human. That we are no
                better, in fact many believe, we are worst than we were
                in past history. What rubbish! My experience on this
                "walkabout" denies this pastime of short changing
                mankind.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">My two-legged
                adversaries in my seven confrontations were armed with
                knives, staffs and machetes. But the six foot, five
                pound solid oak staff with steel at both ends which I
                carry was more than adequate to get the job done. I have
                been down once. Soldiers in the area happened on the
                scene just at the right time. The Jihad extremists were
                the adversaries, in these&nbsp;&nbsp;little skirmish. My
                only injuries up to now have been a very sore head, some
                bruised knuckles and a knife scar on my right forearm. I
                have jokingly said in speaking before groups, that if
                ever I am faced with a gun. "And I haven't got what they
                want. that I will go to the store and purchase it. If
                they will just wait."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The five pound
                staff has been with me, all the way. As has my Bowie
                knife, bull whip, a throwing "hawk" and two balanced
                throwing knifes. When I was in Cape Town, South Africa,
                I had two custom broad swords made. When I am walking,
                each are displayed on each side of my backpack. All the
                weaponry acts as a great deterrent. They have stopped or
                prevented would be serious attacks. When I am lecturing.
                Before I leave the students want a live demonstration
                with the Bull Whip. And if we can arrange a set-up, I do
                some knife and "Tomahawk" throwing.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Although I am
                very optimistic about the future of the human race and
                the World that my great, great grand children will
                inhabit. I am at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;aware that the
                World as we know it today is sadly in need of repair.
                Our direction at times is suspect. And, as we scan this
                great land mass and its' peoples. &nbsp;Our sightings
                speak of many and varied conflicts and utter confusion,
                across the face of the earth. Of a lost-ness that
                lingers and permeates in and out of&nbsp;to&nbsp;many
                relationships both individually and collectively.
                &nbsp;In light of this&nbsp;feeling of lost-ness; our
                sense of security weakens and our fears arise. We ask;
                in what and who do we find our security, where do we
                turn for solace?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">One only has
                to search out the media: listen to the songs of the
                generation, surf the net, listen to the "chat sessions"
                and view the propaganda of our advertising age. Name
                your illusion, all are available. Do you want to rid
                yourself of your sadness and sorrow, your lost identity,
                a missing love and acceptance, a need to belong. All can
                be solved momentarily. A fix can be arranged, for a
                price. The price is your sanity and your very spirit.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We have heard
                the word before. Correction the word has been spoken;
                the hearing of it is questionable. The word is,
                "fragmentation". Our society has been called fragmented,
                as has the family and we as individuals have also earned
                this unflattering name. A quick definition; we haven't
                got it together. Society, the Family, the individual,
                the nation, the countries, the World, all are in a sense
                scattered. We are in pieces and the pieces are out of
                order, disoriented, confused. Which is strange, seeing
                that we live in an orderly Universe, an orderly Cosmos.
                Without this order which is quite visible you and I
                would not be here nor would we be able to survive for
                one moment, unless there was this order.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">What is the
                problem? What is the solution? As always the solution is
                found in the problem. The problem holds the
                answer.&nbsp;<strong>Problem: "Fragmentation" Solution:
                  Un-fragment</strong>. Get it together. Well for the
                moment I have said enough. How did I get off on this
                tangent?</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;"><strong>Back
                  to The African story:</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Long before my
                entry into Africa, I was under the impression or better
                still, the illusion which now seems ludicrous. That
                these eyes of mine had seen a good part of man's
                inhumanity to his fellow beings. The havoc, the
                destruction of the mind, body and the human spirit.
                Caused by the ever present ageless greed, conflicting
                ideologies, exaggerated utterances of ignorance and
                cruelties beyond the bounds of the rational. And all the
                other insanities that surface and play themselves out
                from time to time. Which we tolerate and vehemently deny
                on both a collective and an individual basis. Not only
                as participants but as spectators and victim as well.
                &nbsp;How strange we are at times!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">I had also
                assumed that I had seen the desperation, the utter
                despair, the sense of hopelessness, and the resignation,
                that many face as their day by day reality. Along with
                those many external pollutants out of the political and
                socio-economic menus that de-self and de-face the
                integrity of the human spirit. But my assumptions were
                wrong. One only has to walk through, in and across the
                tear stained face of this troubled Africa.
                To&nbsp;sleep, eat and just be in the midst of the
                tears. To&nbsp;<strong>see and hear</strong> the sights
                and the sounds of the human sufferings, with all
                its'indignities&nbsp;and grievances.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">My steps have
                carried me in and out of the ethnicity of the World: of
                all ages, shapes, sizes, creeds, colors, likes and
                dislikes, the rich and the poor, the illiterates and the
                literate, those who are up and those who are down, the
                advantaged and the disadvantaged, the walking dead, the
                aware and the alive. In and out of all the different
                persuasions, rhetoric, customs, traditions and cultures.
                And the one question that continue to surface over and
                over, out of this seeing. Asks why? Why is it, that our
                reach does not exceed our grasp? Our grasp of knowledge,
                our understanding, our know how and our sense of good
                will to all.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We as humans,
                have been on this earth a long&nbsp;&nbsp;time. And we
                still haven't got it together. We see but we do not see,
                we hear but we do not hear the inequities, the
                injustices that run rampant. Not only in Africa but
                throughout the World. And I am not just speaking about
                the blindness and deafness within, but also that which
                exists without, in the world- at- large. We cannot
                afford to isolate and insulate ourselves to the existing
                ills of Africa. Or for that matter, anywhere in the
                World today. The Global Village is here, we cannot bury
                our heads in the sand, any longer. We are a Family and
                we better start being and acting like a family, now. If
                one suffers we all suffer, if one is lost we
                are&nbsp;lost, if one is in sorrow, we are in sorrow, if
                one is hurt we hurt. No longer can we say; it's over
                there, they or it is not our problem.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">If we would
                just take a moment to stop and ponder, ask and
                investigate. I feel assured that one would find, that
                all of us are inheritors of ideas, concepts,
                assumptions, creeds, dogmas, icons, symbols, myths,
                customs, and traditions. Which have come to us out of
                the past. And that in one way or the other, the past
                thinking then and now was and is still fragmented to
                some degree. We accept a fact as being a fact when it is
                not a fact, we accept a truth as truth when it is not a
                truth,&nbsp;we accept a reality as a reality when it is
                not a reality, we&nbsp;accept love as being love when it
                is not love. Down through time. &nbsp;Mankind&nbsp;has
                accepted many things, believing that his or her
                sequential linear thought, was the truth and nothing but
                the truth. &nbsp;Whole, final and complete. &nbsp;If
                this had been&nbsp;true; &nbsp;t</span><span
                style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">he World would not
                have had to suffer as it has in the past, with all the
                strife, conflict, sorrow. &nbsp;Or the&nbsp;injustices,
                inequalities, brutalities and the human err that goes on
                and on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">All the great
                thinkers, philosophers, masters, teachers gurus,
                enlightened ones, righteous ones. All the creeds,
                dogmas, encyclicals, ecclesiastical utterances,
                churches, mosques, temples, ashrams and shrines have not
                been able to bring order out of the disorder. Why?
                &nbsp;Because humanity has not been able to shake its'
                own disorder, its' fragmentary thinking. Even in the
                above list of things mentioned. All suffered, due to
                this fragmentary, hit and miss approach to life. Adding
                to the confusion and conflict that has existed and still
                does. The very insights and truths of the many
                religious' offerings, have been so distorted, diluted
                and tampered with. That they are unrecognizable as being
                the "Truth". Religion has made the spiritual into its'
                own image. The describers of these religions, have
                attempted to describe, to define the Indefinable. The
                builders, or those behind the building of the earthly
                churches, the temples, the mosques, the shrines, sites
                and other places where man worships his God, or whatever
                semantic he has chosen to give to the Ineffable, the
                Indefinable, the Un-pronoun-able. The Source of "All and
                Everything". Have in their fragmented thinking. Allowed
                all the trappings to become and end unto themselves.
                Whether we are talking about symbols, rituals, creeds
                and even the "Word". As has been said before in past
                writings;"the blossom must fall before the fruit can
                appear."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">All the lights
                along the way, all the benchmarks, all the revelations,
                insights, affirmations are pointing beyond themselves.
                The great "Truth" of the Christian Affirmation, <i>pointed
                  beyond</i> himself. And to all who have the ears to
                hear. The insight that disallows fragmented thinking,
                lies in these words" Not my will but <b>His Will Be
                  Done</b>. " Please do not ask, how. Do not analyze,
                investigate, or even think about it. Just become and be
                "<b>THE WILL</b>" Just "<i>be still</i> and"<i>just do
                  it</i>." Do not bring in all the fragmentary thoughts
                out of your past, stop all incoming calls from the past
                and the future. Dis-attach, dis-identify. "<b>BE STILL
                  AND KNOW" AND YOU WILL KNOW "THAT" which just IS</b>.
                Is their a process, a method, a how to? No, No a
                thousand times "no". You are the method, the process.
                You have been given everything you need, to "<b>know</b>".</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Are there
                points of light in Africa, is there daylight for the
                darkness of this Continent? "Yes, the darkness is
                receding. On this journey I have met those whose reach
                does exceed their grasp. They are in Africa for all the
                right reasons, their motives are not of self-interest.
                They are not takers, they are givers. They are not their
                to find themselves or their identity. They are simply
                there to find those who need help and to reach out to
                them, in what every way is needed. They have learned to
                go beyond the written word, the directives, the endless
                meetings and the sea of rhetoric. They are the doers.
                They act instead of react. Compassion, care and love are
                not words to them, they are acts. They have learned to
                become and be the definitive definition of these words.
                They are the Word. This is how transformation takes
                place for the doer and the recipient.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is sad but,
                true, helping Africa has become big business. There are
                thousands of these alphabet organizations,
                criss-crossing this Continent in their big Land-Rovers
                and Toyota Land Cruisers, flying their humanitarian
                flags. With their vehicles carrying their acronyms and
                slogans. A book could be written about the waste and the
                reduplicating of services. The style and comfort of the
                upper of these helping organizations, where 75% or more
                of the moneys received goes towards operating costs and
                salaries. Leaving very little for the grass roots need.
                Many of these smoke and light shows are done in the name
                of love and concern. I came across a Church outside of
                Khartoum in Sudan. That rented out there facilities.
                Even to the point of changing the name of the church, so
                brochure shots could be made. So that the Church that
                was being promoted back in the states. Could show where
                the buildings funds were spent. They even had stand in
                children, to show the missionary work that was being
                done. I saw the finished brochure, quite slick as were
                the promoters. I wondered at the time, how often this is
                done. Not only in Africa but elsewhere.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">But back to
                the more positive side, as to those who are making a
                difference, while living in the midst of the needy. The
                moneys they receive is minimal. They live, eat, laugh,
                cry and suffer; 'a la' Father Damian and his lepers. As
                they offered their expertise and services. There are
                those who have families.&nbsp;Living the same austere
                life as the villagers. It seems evident that these
                worker teachers are the embodiment of their commitment.
                And those around them have caught their spirit. These
                workers have proven that more is caught than taught.
                They teach by being their commitment..</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">For the
                selfless and the concerned, there are no words to
                express the service they are rendering and the ripple
                effect that will live on, inspiring and affecting future
                generations. Many of these light-givers speak of that
                special someone, who lit up their lives and the fire in
                their minds and hearts. Giving meaning and life to their
                lives.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">There are
                forces at work in the World, in the most unlikely
                places. Moving segments of humanity little by little
                towards a Global village concept. Even though many will
                have to be dragged, while screaming and kicking about
                losing their identify. One would have to be deaf, dumb
                and blind not to see that the World is in transition and
                that the future of the World lies in the "One World"
                concept. The handwriting is on the wall and visible
                inroads are happening in the Communication field and in
                the area of E-Commerce.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Within the
                Twenty-First Century, no country will be able to
                isolate, control and limit their peoples' freedom.
                Between World wide television, inter-net and satellite
                capabilities, the chains that have made the mind a
                prisoner will be broken. The unchained melody of the
                peoples of the world, will carry the words; freedom for
                all people, where ever they might be. The enslavement of
                the mind and the will of the people will become an
                anachronism. Dictators and power structures will topple.
                The truth will indeed free the imprisoned of the World.
                De-structuring will replace the old for the betterment
                of all. We can no longer carry the deadness of the past;
                we "need to let the dead bury the dead". The New World
                dawning, is for the living, and it will move on, with or
                without us. This dawning is in the making. We will see a
                World of food security for all, where starvation will
                become a thing of the past. A World where illiteracy
                will be eradicated, along with poverty. A World where
                there will be a level playing field for all peoples,
                countries and nations. A World where all the inherent
                inalienable rights, all the freedoms and the pursuit of
                the good, the better and the more excellent will be open
                to all and everyone, should they so choose.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">This World
                vision is an evolving, growing consciousness which is
                gaining adherence across the various disciplines of the
                social and the geo-political sciences, the academic and
                the religious, the philosophical and psychological
                sectors of the World. Plus the beginnings of a grass
                root movement of the citizens of the World, who envision
                this. And believe it can and will be a reality. The time
                table is unknown, but the womb is being prepared and the
                birth will take place. But as with all births, there is
                a certain amount of risk and labor. And in some cases a
                difficult time with complications. And yes, even death
                but not the extinction of the birthing cycle. We must
                always remember that the World we live in, along with
                all the other solar systems and their planets. And we as
                the human species of earth, took a&nbsp;long time to
                come to this point in time and space, eons and eons.
                More than the mind can fathom. But finally we arrived
                and took our place in the evolutionary scale. And we are
                growing and evolving, each tiny step along the way. Not
                as fast as we would like it to be, but we have always
                been impatient. It takes time for quality. The "Original
                Intent" will come to pass.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">The human
                birthing process has its' own rhythm, the Worlds'
                process is no different, It has its timing. There is a
                time for crawling, for walking and running. The Creation
                of the physical World started fast and ends slowly.
                Evolution starts slow and ends fast. This we can
                observe, in the technological World. Once we entered
                into the Industrial arena. We began to pick up momentum
                and now we see the increasing acceleration that is
                moving at an unbelievable pace. Which makes it
                exceedingly difficult to keep abreast of the daily
                innovations and advancements. You buy something today it
                is obsolete the next morning.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It has been
                said; "there is a time and season for everything". I
                have heard the cynics of the world,&nbsp;since the age
                of twelve predicting the end of the world, or the
                extinction of the human race.&nbsp;I have ask myself,
                time and time again. How does one live out their life
                caught up in such a negative posture, such a down beat.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We cannot give
                psychological or spiritual awareness or life to another.
                They need to lose their pain, sorrow, hurt and
                loneliness themselves, death must come to these things.
                Before a new birth can take place. All of life is in a
                constant process of dying and rebirth.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">Let us just
                place a comma here. In looking back to Africa, it has
                given me an experience, I will never be able to give
                enough thanksgiving for all its' gifts of insight, of
                its' peaks and its' valleys. I have delighted in its'
                people. In its' grandeur and beauty of the land.. And my
                spirit has wept for the spirit of Africa. There were so
                many moments, when I felt that my eyes, my ears, my very
                soul, could not see, hear or feel anymore. That I could
                not hold, nor feel any more pain and sorrow, and yes,
                pity. How much longer are we as humans going to keep on
                living in our comfort zones and remain immune to the
                suffering, the anguish, the pain and sorrow of millions
                upon millions.&nbsp;To be even more specific. When are
                we going to see those, whom we refuse to see daily.
                Those we dismiss so flippantly with our tired worn out
                phrases and jokes, that are so degrading not only to
                those whom we believe are sub-human, but so degrading to
                ourselves. The verbal assault, the abuse is not in their
                best interest or in ours. For eventually we become
                lesser than those we abuse in whatever way. Be it
                subtlety or blatantly.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We are on the
                threshold of a new dawning, a new millennium. How shall
                we fare, in this new era? Will we break the chains of
                bigotry, prejudice, separateness and isolationism? Will
                there no longer be a need for such words as; caste
                systems, class distinctions, the "have" and the"have
                nots", the washed and the unwashed, the literate and the
                non-literate, the chosen and the saved? Or any other
                type of phrasing that relegates any human being, whoever
                they might be or not be. To a status that is sub-human,
                that is beneath ones' human dignity.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">We have
                practiced our fragmentary thinking far to long, we need
                to be done with it. And enter this new millennium, as
                peoples who devoid themselves of the pasts' way of
                thinking and doing business as usual. And it's
                programming of our minds, hearts and spirits in the way
                it was. We as the human race have been at this business
                of trying to right the ills and conflicts, the sorrows
                and the miseries of this World of ours for a long, long
                time. With little to show for it, in the psychological
                and spiritual departments.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">It is time we
                see ourselves, the world, and its' people. And the
                things of this world and all the worlds beyond, as <strong>family.
                  We are one, we are connected. "All and everything" is
                  part of a unitive system. It is out of this unity that
                  balance and harmony will come. And our fragmentary
                  thinking will become whole.</strong></span></p>
            <strong>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;">And it will
                  truly be;&nbsp;<strong>" One for all and all for One".</strong></span></p>
