            <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">We, arrived in
              Bullard,Texas on a Friday, prior to the second Sunday.
              That Sunday, when all new Pastors were to preach their
              first sermon in their new Charge. As we pulled up in the
              driveway of the parsonage, we were greeted by some of the
              members of the Church. The parsonage was located on a lot
              back of the Church. It was a fairly new parsonage, three
              bedrooms, a good size living room, kitchen and one bath.
              It was about two or three years old, in very good
              condition. Everybody introduced themselves and we all went
              into the parsonage. It had been redone and redecorated;
              the walls had been repainted.&nbsp;It was evident that
              some new pieces of furniture had been added. It had a very
              large backyard. All in all, it was very nice. I do
              believe, Babs was also pleased, it sure was larger than
              the apartment we had in Houston.</span>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The Church
                itself was small. It had a brick exterior with beautiful
                stained glass windows. The sanctuary had an aisle in the
                middle that separated the pews, and a chancel area that
                was arranged in a "mix and match" fashion. The pulpit
                was way over to one side. The organ (spinet type) and a
                piano, were side by side. The Communion Table and the
                Baptismal Fount were on the opposite side of the Chancel
                area from the Pulpit. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Also, there
                were about twelve chairs in the midst of all this, along
                with&nbsp;some old hymn books and&nbsp;other
                miscellaneous odds and ends stacked on a small
                table&nbsp;back in the corner of the Chancel area. It
                all look like it had just sprouted, taken root and grown
                there over the years. Similar to&nbsp;a garage that
                grows and collects things, never to be thrown out.
                And&nbsp;eventually the car is evicted and has to live
                outside. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Well, being a
                new Pastor, what did I know, I set about rearranging
                things to give some appearance of order and symmetry.
                After about three hours of work, I had the Communion
                Table down below, centered in front of the Chancel Area
                with the Pulpit centered behind the Communion Table. The
                choir chairs were split in back of the pulpit. The organ
                and the piano were separated, organ to the right, piano
                to the left. The Baptismal Fount and the Pastors' Pulpit
                chair were to the right, near the side steps, leading up
                to the Chancel area, near the door leading to the
                Pastor's study. I cleaned out all the old stacked up
                literature, the ragged hymnals and miscellaneous
                hodgepodge. It looked like a different Sanctuary.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Meanwhile,
                Babs was busy unpacking, putting things away, getting
                the house in order. Making a home instead of a house. I
                took my books and some other things over to the office.
                After moving some things out of the office that were not
                needed, the office began to take shape. Come Sunday,
                everything was ship shape. I had even printed the
                Bulletins for Sunday, using an old cylinder Mimeograph
                machine. Affectionately called a "Holy Roller". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Come Saturday
                morning, I walked the town, it took about five minutes
                to do the Downtown area. The Township in about a
                half-hour. Of course it was evident that the people
                around town knew who I was, even though I didn't know
                who they were. I stopped in all three Stores and the
                Filling Station and oh, yes, the Post Office. The
                Postmaster, said; "you must be the new Methodist
                "Preacher", (that's what&nbsp;they do say!) Saw you
                drive in Friday. Got any kids?" "Afraid not." I replied.
                "Didn't think so, couldn't see any in the car, unless
                they were asleep." "Born in Texas, were you?" "No, in
                Indiana." "A Yankee, huh." "Yelp" (that is Texan, for
                "yes.") After I had finished filling out a new address
                form, so our mail from Houston would be forwarded, I
                said "good-bye, see you around". And then I "moseyed"
                (that's another one of them there Texan words) on down
                the street. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">"Oh, Happy
                Day", Sunday! here it was, ready or not. Babs and I put
                on our best "Bib an Tucker" and to Church we went. We
                got there about fifteen minutes before the 11 o-clock,
                starting time, the Church was almost full. All had come
                to see the new "Preacher" and his wife. The Town had
                been buzzing, about the Preacher and his young bride;"
                (Had you heard, this is his second wife. He's divorced,
                you know?") </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Babs seated
                herself, near the front I am sure she felt like "a fish
                in a Fish Bowl". I quickly told the Organist and the
                Piano Player, that I would announce all the Hymns as
                listed in the Program, to the Congregation throughout
                the Service. Since it varied from what they had been
                used too. I stepped behind the Pulpit and said; "Good
                morning, welcome to First Methodist Church. "The Lord is
                in His Holy Church, let us bow down and worship Him".
                The first Hymn of the morning, is "<em>Holy, Holy Holy,
                  Merciful and Mighty"</em>.Let us please stand". After
                the first Hymn and a brief prayer, I stepped down out of
                the Chancel area and asked Babs to join me. After
                introducing my wife, I offered the usual amenities
                about, "to know you. "Getting to know all about you."
                Then, I announced the Sermon for the <em>Evening
                  Service</em> "Will The Real Lee and Babs Stand Up".
                There will even be a "Question and Answer" period,
                afterwards". That caused a whisper or two. The rest of
                the Service went quickly, we were out by 'Twelve' sharp.
                Either before or after the sermon, I commented that; "I
                don't mind if you look at your watches. It is only when
                you shake them to see if they are still running." When
                the service was over. Babs and I &nbsp;stood by the door
                to shake hands. As the last one passed by I said to
                myself, some of these I will never see again until, come
                Christmas.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">After Church,
                we were invited &nbsp;for Sunday dinner. Mr. Owen was
                the Chairman of the Board. During the dinner, we
                exchanged the usual pleasantries, then Mr. Owen said;
                "The Church looked sort of different this morning,
                didn't it, dear?. We were a little bit surprised!" After
                a long pause, Mrs. Owens said; "You know dear, I like
                the way it looked." I could have kissed that women,
                right then and there. "I agree, it did look good", Mr.
                Owen replied. I breathed a long sigh of relief. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Like most
                Ministers, I could probably write a book about my first
                Pastorate. About Bab's reaction and her painful attempt
                to adjust to the remoteness of Bullard. With its lack of
                young people her age. And the Congregations'
                expectations of a Pastors' wife. I tried to soften the
                last one by addressing it in the Sunday evening service
                which I had announced. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">That evening,
                the topic of the sermon must have aroused some
                curiosity, the Church was full. I even noticed that
                there were some who had not been in the Morning
                service.&nbsp;When it came time for the sermon, I
                stepped down in front of the Congregation. And said
                words to the effect (which by the way I used each time I
                was appointed to a new Church).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">First, that
                Babs was not hired to be the second minister, "what you
                see's, is what you get." (referring to myself) "I hope
                that you and I can share the good times and the bad
                times of one another. And do what is needed, to be what
                a Church should be. Babs may or may not want to teach a
                Sunday school class, a Bible Class or become a member of
                the W.C.S., unless she so chooses. She is first and
                foremost my wife, but much more than that, she is a
                person with her own identity. She is not the "Preacher's
                Wife", she has a name. And while we are on the subject
                of names, I also have a name and it is not, "Hey!
                Preacher". In fact, I wouldn't mind it, if you were to
                call me, Lee. I would prefer this to "Preacher". For I
                would hope that my training has prepared me to do far
                more than just preach." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">You could
                have heard a pin drop. I went on to say; "My call to the
                ministry, was out of a need to give something of myself.
                I did not have a '<em>road to Damascus'</em> experience,
                and fall off of a jackass like Saul of Tarsus. I have
                come out of the secular 'world of work', I have done
                many things. I joined the ministry, so that I could grow
                and understand how the "Word became flesh". And how it
                might become my flesh and then, maybe help you to
                understand this "process". Also I will bring to the
                table all I have to give. I would ask that you do the
                same. And maybe, just maybe, you and I together can be
                the Church, that is needed in this community". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">"Also, I ask
                you to remember that I was created a man first. When I
                came upon the scene, The doctor didn't say to my Mother;
                "you have a son and he is a Minister". Or my Father
                didn't say; "Oh, look!, he's a Minister". I am a
                Minister by choice. The training I have received is out
                of the secular arena. A Church, needs to be "business
                sound" and in many ways run like any other business. If
                it is to be successful. "Yes, I am aware and know that a
                Church is much more than just a business. I am aware of
                its' History to some extent. The Spiritual dimensions of
                a Church is its' core and we remind ourselves of this
                each Sunday, as we pay mind to the tenants of our
                faith,&nbsp;as we recite the <em>Apostles' Creed</em>
                and read the lessons from the Scriptures. If you will
                help me to be more spiritually sound, I will help you
                and the Church to be more business sound. Is that a
                deal?" I hope your answer is "Yes"!&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">"The
                Methodist Discipline states that I am 'Pastor in
                Charge'. That could be interpreted in many ways. I would
                rather believe that all of us have been given a Charge,
                when we were Baptized and joined the Church (The Body of
                Christ). That we are charged each time we take Communion
                and hear the words; "Take eat and drink and do this in
                Remembrance of me."&nbsp;Also, we should remember our
                charge, when we see those in need, those who are less
                fortunate than we are. We should remember our charge,
                when we see the Lord's house is in need of&nbsp;repair
                or&nbsp;the grass is "as high as an elephant's eye." And
                the most important charge of all; "not my will but thy
                will be done." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">"Are we not
                all Pilgrims along the way seeking for the abundant
                life? That life, that gives meaning and purpose to that
                which we say and do, day by day. That life, that helps
                us to understand that we are not in this, all alone.
                That not only do we have each other, but we have a
                Father and his Son, our brother, who is on our side. To
                remind us, as to who we are. That we were created in the
                'Image'; in the same likeness, the same substance. The
                words rang loud and clear down through the corridors of
                time; "Let us create man in our image, in our likeness."
                Of course, today we know and accept, this includes the
                opposite sex as well. None of us are chopped liver." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">In essence
                this was the message that evening. The morning sermon
                was; '<em>What Is Your Ultimate Concern'?</em> </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The Pastorate
                lasted three years in Bullard, Mark Lee was borne while
                we were there, in a Hospital located in Jacksonville,
                Texas. Now there was Babs, I and baby makes three. Also
                in that last year in Bullard. I learned that if, I would
                attend a Summer Course at Perkins School of Theology on
                the campus of Southern Methodist University, for six
                weeks. I could get credit for a whole years'
                correspondence work. At that point I had completed two
                an a half years towards the required seven years to
                become an ordained Elder in the Methodist Church. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I jumped at
                the chance. After the completion of the summer courses,
                several of the Seminary's' professors (Dr. Grimes, Dr.
                Jackson and Dr. Judy) spoke to the Dean, an appointment
                was set up for me to speak to Dr.Quillian about entering
                Perkins, why not? None of the Professors were aware of
                the fact that I had not finished High School. The day of
                the appointment with Dr. Quillian came, I was ushered
                into the Dean's office, we exchanged some opening
                remarks. He said that several of the Professors had
                mentioned my name to him. And that they believed I
                should be in Seminary, due to the work and the
                contributions I had made during the summer session. Then
                Dean Quillian asked; "The Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar
                Question". "By the way where did you go to College?" I
                knew the question had to come up, but I was hoping for
                it to be a little later in the conversation. Without
                flinching, I said; " I didn't go to college." Did you
                graduate from High School?" Was his next question,"No,
                sir, I quit High School before my senior year and
                entered the Second World War". In his Southern drawl, he
                said; "No one has ever come to Perkins or any other
                Seminary&nbsp;without a College Degree, let alone
                without a High School Diploma. It just is not done". </span></p>
            <div><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">He went on
                to say that the Regents Board of the University would
                not allow it. And further more, it would affect the
                Seminary's Accreditation standing, academically. My
                reply was, although I did not understand everything he
                said; "Wouldn't it be interesting to allow some one who
                is out of the Secular 'work a day world', and who is of
                my age (33) to attend Perkins and see what they could
                accomplish?".The Dean said; "we couldn't get it
                approved. Plus, there would be some Faculty members, who
                would object. Not to mention some of the Conference
                Ministerial Boards and their comments".</span></div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">At this
                point I asked; "Wouldn't it put Perkins on the cutting
                edge and prove that Perkins is progressive and adaptive
                to the times. Is it not a fact that the number of older
                men coming into the ministry is on the upswing. More and
                more men are deciding to enter the Ministry, later in
                life. Don't these men deserve the best training the
                Methodist Church has to offer. Is not Perkins the place
                to get that better training. Bringing older men into
                Perkins, who have the work a day experience might prove
                to be invaluable and advantageous. Creating an
                inter-generational atmosphere among the students. The
                young and older could both benefit". </span></div>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Dean Quillian
                said: "Have you ever considered the Law profession?" You
                have made your point. And made it well. Maybe the time
                is right to expand our horizons and reach out to that
                age group, who are entering the Ministry later in life.
                And yes, the cross pollination might add a different
                dimension in our classrooms, and to the seminar
                sessions. Plus, give the Faculty a chance to hear a new
                perception, from the 'man on the street', so to speak. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I want you to
                go home and write a paper. On why you should be admitted
                to Perkins? Stating your case, as you just did. Tell us;
                the Faculty and the Regents Board; why Seminary training
                would help you, to be a better Pastor in the World as it
                is today?. " And why you think your experience in the
                'work a day' world, would be of benefit to Perkins? ".
                And lastly; " Why at Thirty-three years of age did you
                decide to become a Minister and choose the Methodist
                Church? " </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Before
                leaving the Seminary, and driving back to Bullard. I
                stopped in each of the Offices and thanked each of the
                Professors. Who went that extra mile for one of their
                students. I also slipped into one of the empty
                classrooms and took a seat. I closed my eyes and
                visualized myself in a classroom that was in session.
                With the Professor lecturing on Church History and I was
                taking notes, feverishly. Trying to keep up and
                listening as hard as I could. And then I raised my hand
                and&nbsp;asked a question. It was so real to me, I
                opened my eyes, and I knew. I knew, I would be in that
                room in the near future, raising my hand and asking a
                question. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">This little
                exercise, I had practice, even as a young boy in
                learning a particular sport, and making the team. And
                later in life, in all the jobs I applied for and got. I
                believed in the process. I used to think the basketball
                into the basket. But I also practiced, practiced and
                practiced. I would go to twenty different places on the
                basketball court, half court. And start shooting, if I
                would make twenty in a row, I would go home. If a made
                five and missed the sixth one. I would start over. If I
                got to ten and missed the next one. I would go back to
                one and start again. If I got to nineteen and missed,
                back to one again. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I was taught
                that if you are going to learn something, learn how to
                do it good. When you learn how to do it good. Practice
                until your better. When you become better, practice
                until you reach your maximum potential. I have never
                forgotten that lesson. There is no age, where a person
                can not learn something new, if she or he still has most
                of their capacities&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">But back to
                the story </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I drove back
                home, and could not wait to tell Babs about what had
                happened with Dean Quillian. She didn't exactly dance an
                "Irish jig" or turn cartwheels but she seemed faintly
                interested. I was ecstatic, I wrote a three page letter.
                A week later, I was asked to come to Perkins. I put the
                "metal to the pedal". I was in Dallas in record time.
                When I arrived at Perkins, Mrs. Nettles ushered me into
                the Dean's office. He came in shortly afterwards, we
                exchanged some questions and answers. And then, he said
                to me; your request to attend Perkins has carefully been
                studied by all the interested parties. We would like for
                you, if you would agree, to spend a week taking a number
                of tests both written and oral. Would you agree to that?
                I could hardly contain myself. I would have agreed to
                just about anything at that point, well almost anything.
              </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Later, in the
                week I went up on the hill to the University
                (SMU)&nbsp;and met with the Personnel staff, that had
                prepared the tests I was to take. They explained each
                test, as I took them. And told me, if there was a time
                limit for a particular test. There were tests; that
                tested my reading skills; how well I retained
                information, how well I understood what I read. In fact
                there were several kinds of comprehensive reading tests.
                How fast could I read and then give it back , putting it
                into my own my words. There were vocabulary tests. There
                were oral tests to show verbal acuity. Personality
                tests, Minnesota something, a Millers' Analogy Test. And
                more tests, which took about four an a half days in all.
                Each evening when I drove back to Bullard, I was punchy.
                Finally it was over. All that remained, was possibly the
                shouting, I repeated the Classroom visualization,
                whenever possible. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Three weeks
                to the day, I saw Dean Quillian, at a Lakeview Assembly,
                I knew he would be there. I cut through the crowd, he
                saw me coming. He said; "you are almost there, we have
                one more request. We would like for you, to come&nbsp;to
                Perkins&nbsp;and answer some questions from some of the
                Faculty. And also some questions, from those who
                administered your tests. Could we arrange a meeting, say
                for next week? I'll have Mrs. Nettles call you". At that
                point, I knew it would happen. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I drove to
                Dallas for the final interview, hoping that the next
                time I drove to Dallas would be to enter Seminary, as a
                full time student. All were assembled; everybody shook
                hands, introductions were made, everybody settled in,
                for the 'questions and answer' period. Dean Quillian
                said; " Let us begin" as he lit his pipe. The questions
                began, they were of a general nature about my childhood,
                parents, schooling, Army service, past jobs, religious
                background, etc. After all the give and take, the humor
                and laughing, it was over. By consensus, I was admitted
                as a Probationary student, to start Seminary in the
                fall. Which was just around the corner. There were no
                guarantees. My performance would be assessed each
                quarter. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">After the
                meeting was over,&nbsp;Dr. Quillian said to me; "that
                there were no promises beyond my receiving a Seminary
                training in the next three years. It will replace the
                correspondence work you have been doing. Dr. Holt will
                help in finding you some financial aid and some
                scholarship moneys. He also said, that arrangements
                would be made between the North Texas Conference and the
                Texas Conference, And that a new Supply Pastor would be
                assigned to the Bullard Church". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">His parting
                remark; "you have been given the opportunity. To break
                new ground, many people have put their necks on the line
                for you, amid much criticism. The Seminary, also has a
                stake in this experiment. Many of us believe you have
                the ability and the drive to succeed. Don't let them
                down. My door is always open to you, should you have any
                problems. Lee, you need to make the disbelievers, into
                believers". I thanked him, for all that he had done on
                my behalf. And told him that "I would do the job
                expected of me. I hadn't come this far, to fail". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Looking back
                on my life, I have had so many, to use Maslow's term "
                peak experiences". Those moments, those "NOW's" and
                "WOW'S. But the moment, I knew I was accepted to
                Perkins, what a high! </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I rushed back
                home to tell Babs the wonderful news, but as I was
                driving back home, my joy was mixed with bittersweet.
                &nbsp;I told Babs all that happened . And that we would
                be moving to Dallas by the next month, living on campus
                in the married couples' Dorm&nbsp;with children.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Come Sunday,
                I announced, that Babs, Mark Lee and myself would be
                leaving for Dallas. That I had been accepted as a
                special student at Perkins School of Theology. Many knew
                that this might happen. For they were aware that I was
                trying to get into Seminary. That Sunday after Church
                and when we left, both Babs and I shed a few tears. As
                we pulled out of the driveway, we waved good-bye to
                those who had gathered. And to the dog and cat we left
                behind. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Dallas, "Here
                we come". </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The newness
                of everything, new friends, new surroundings, new
                challenges. It took Babs time to relax, to become
                friends with some of the wives in the Dorm. And also to
                be in an academic atmosphere. Most of the wives were
                college graduates or if not graduates, had some college
                credits. Acceptance and belonging fears, surfaced for
                Babs. I thought the fears would eventually&nbsp;pass but
                they surfaced from time to time.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I was soaking
                up the Seminary experience like a big fat sponge. I was
                starved for knowledge because I had always felt that
                somehow I had been penalized throughout my life, for not
                having a diploma. So I could compete with some equity in
                the business world against the College graduates. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The first
                year I took a full load, of 16 credits. Later in the
                year, I took on the job of Dorm supervisor. Mrs.
                Nettles, the Deans' secretary was in charge of the Dorm
                Supervisors, when the job came open she recommend me and
                I got the job. And shortly after that I took on three
                Circuit Churches in the Waxahachie District of the North
                Texas Conference. They were ideal, come each Sunday,
                Babs, Mark and myself would pile into the car, about
                nine or nine-thirty, and drive; to Ennis, Texas, for the
                ten-o-clock Church service. After I had finished
                preaching, we would all get back into the car and drive
                to the next Church, which was Oak Grove, if my memory
                serves me. For the second service at eleven-o-clock..
                After the Service was over, back into the car again to
                return to Dallas. Unless we were invited out to lunch.
                After lunch, then back to the Seminary. In the evening,
                I would drive to the third church for their evening
                service. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I preached
                the same sermon at all three Churches. Then I would
                drive back to Seminary that night. I said earlier that
                the appointment was ideal. All the other married
                students that had Circuit Churches, would have to leave
                on a Friday evening and get back late Sunday evening,
                that was difficult. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Between the
                three churches, the Dorm supervisors' job, studies,
                marriage and the Perkins Sports program which I headed
                up, kept me fairly busy. There were times I met myself
                coming and going. My grades hovered in an around a 3.5
                average. Babs was adjusting slowly to campus life. She
                had her good days and her bad days. In those bad days, a
                depression would set in, followed by boredom and
                discontentment. Anything could trigger it, I never knew
                when the thunder and lighting would occur. The worst
                times would be when I was trying to get a paper finished
                before the deadline set by a Professor. Or while driving
                to the Church service on a Sunday morning. Trying to
                collect my thoughts; thinking about the points of the
                sermon, the announcements that had to be made. And then,
                'wham, bamm'!, thank you ma'am'!, all of a sudden I
                would find myself in the 'eye of the storm'. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">As we would
                pull up in front of the Church, I would step from the
                car as though, I just stepped off of the "Love Boat." To
                meet the first Parishioner. " Good Morning, " How have
                you been? Lovely day isn't it?" Down the aisle, step
                into the pulpit, check to see if I was all there, after
                the tornado. Again, a "Good morning, our opening hymn is
                " Love Lifted Me " [as I thought to myself, If only they
                knew.] The title should have been; "The Love Elevator Is
                Out Of Order"</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">These little
                vignettes surfaced at the most awkward of times. But,
                that's life! Babs couldn't understand my silence in
                these moments. But, silence was my only refuge, if I was
                to retain my sanity. There of course was another
                alternative, to get into a knock down, dragged out
                fight. And do a lot of shouting and screaming, and
                afterwards ask yourself, what was that all about? Now,
                one has yet another alternative, to sit down and try to
                discuss the whole thing rationally. But that is easier
                said, than done. At one time, we went to a Marriage
                Counselor. But that was short lived. Babs thought the
                Counselor was taking sides. The wrong side.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Two words
                are&nbsp;repeatedly used as reasons for the parting of
                the way. Both&nbsp;in counseling and in the Court of
                Law. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incompatibility</span>
                and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irreconcilable</span>
                differences, both these words cover the waterfront. But
                why incompatible and why irreconcilable? Without going
                into ones' childhood, ones' relationship with either one
                of the parents. Ones', repressed or suppressed urges,
                sibling rivalry, or the pecking order. Whether the
                parents were overly strict or practiced a hands off
                approach. Whether love was shown,&nbsp;or evident in the
                family relationships, etc., etc., etc. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I am going to
                paint a very large brush stroke and say; that a good
                part of the trouble in many Marriages stems from the
                fact that one or both are suffering from a low
                self-esteem and or&nbsp;a lack of self-respect. And that
                in a majority of cases this has its' roots, in that <em>People
                  do not love or like themselves</em>. Or, some go as
                far as hating themselves. I know that this a simplistic
                answer, but it bears thought. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Sorry for the
                lapse, back to the story at hand. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">At the end of
                the third year, near Graduation time. I was informed by
                the Dean's office. That the Board of Regents of the
                University, was reviewing the possibility of giving me a
                'Graduate' diploma. So I could graduate with the rest of
                my class.. Well, it happened, I was given a Graduate
                Degree. The day of my Graduation, a 'dream came true'. I
                had beaten the odds and did it my way. With a lot help
                from the sidelines;&nbsp;with an&nbsp;act of concern and
                interest by three Professors which had started the ball
                rolling. Then Dean Quillian and his courage and effort
                to do something different. The support of the people on
                the "Hill" that gave my testing. And all the Faculty
                that were pulling for me. Plus, all the well-wishers
                that encouraged me. Hey!, with a support team like that
                was there any doubt. I do not believe at any point
                throughout my Seminary challenge, did I ever hear any
                words of encouragement from my spouse. Nor, upon my
                receiving a Degree over all odds, did I hear anything..
                Except she did not want to be a ministers' wife. And
                that I thought more about the Church, than of her. Well
                they do say; 'that some people like to rain on other
                peoples' parade'.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Just before
                Graduation, I was approached by a Dr. Leighton Farrell,
                who at that time was liaison to Bishop Pope, the
                presiding Bishop over the North and Central Conferences.
                Leighton was to be appointed, come June appointments, to
                the&nbsp;'First United Methodist Church' in Richardson,
                Texas. A much sought after Church appointment. Leighton
                wanted me, as his associate pastor. Initially, I said; "
                No." I wanted my own Church,&nbsp;to be the Pastor in
                charge. But after much discussion, I finally accepted
                his offer. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Unknowingly,
                I had made a number of enemies in two Conferences. Sort
                of a hostile envy existed. It had started in the Texas
                Conference and spread into the North Texas Conference.
                Underlying rumors and criticism about my coming in
                through the " back door." Because of having been allowed
                into Seminary without a High School diploma and no
                College. And then being awarded a 'Graduate Degree'. And
                on top of that, a prearranged prestige Associate
                appointment via the Bishop's Office. There were some
                very unhappy people; ministers, Superintendents and
                members of the Ministerial Qualification Boards of both
                Conferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The
                Ministerial Qualifications Board of each Conference
                reviews all graduates for their Elders' Ordination. Your
                fate is in their hands, they can say; " Yes " or " No. "
                When I was called in to stand before the Board; the
                Chairman of the Board was Rev. Henry Lawson, to put it
                mildly,&nbsp;he was not a "happy camper". He questioned
                the validity of my attending Seminary without a High
                School Diploma. He opposed; on the grounds that it was
                not in compliance with the conditions laid out in the
                'Methodist Discipline'. He also questioned the validity
                of my Seminary training, inferring preferential
                treatment as a special student. Later, he brought up the
                fact that I had been divorced and that it was known that
                I smoked and drank a beer, now and then while in
                Seminary. I reminded him of the fact that the smoking
                and drinking issue had been resolved by a 'General
                Conference' vote. That any questions related to smoking
                and drinking had been revised in the 'Discipline' by a
                majority vote. And that one could not be asked whether
                they smoked or imbibed? That, the 'Discipline' had
                relegated these questions to be a "matter of
                conscience". And furthermore, as to my Seminary
                experience, I wanted to remind, the right Reverend
                Lawson "that,..."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Before&nbsp;I
                could finish the sentence. Dean Quillian stood and said;
                "I think at this point, I need to say something, if Mr.
                Mc Ginnis doesn't mind. stepping out of the room for a
                moment". I yielded the floor and stepped out of the
                room. I learned afterwards, I was well represented by
                Dean Quillian and Mr. Lawson deferred.. The Board did
                how ever recommend that I set up an appointment to see
                the Conference appointed Counselor, Dee Wickston for an
                evaluation. This had been the trade off. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I had the
                appointment;&nbsp;during the conversation with Dee
                Wickston; he said that the animosity of the Board
                towards me was a backlash. That the Board felt as though
                it had been slighted and by-passed, by the Bishop and
                Leighton in regards to my appointment as his Associate
                to First United Methodist Church in Richardson, Texas.
                He gave me a clean bill of stability. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">After
                Graduation; the three of us moved to Richardson, Texas,
                and my new assignment. 'First United Methodist Church'
                was a great Church, it was in one of the fastest growing
                areas outside the limits of Metropolitan Dallas. A
                Bedroom Community which housed "Collins Electric" and
                "Texas Instruments", both Companies were in the fast
                growing Computer market. As they grew, First Church grew
                right along with them. The Church's' Membership moved
                from three thousand to six thousand, in three years. The
                Church's Ministerial staff went from two to five, the
                Educational coordinators and the Office Staff was also
                increased. A new Educational wing was built, the Church
                had outgrown its' facilities. Leighton knew how to get
                things done, he pressed the right buttons. He was people
                wise. A well-rounded Pastor, who worked under a hidden
                stress. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">After three
                years apprenticeship with Leighton, I opted to start a
                new Church. I was appointed to a yet to be named Church
                on the borderline between the City of Richardson and the
                City of Garland. The Church was finally named 'Richland
                United Methodist Church'. Our first Church service was
                held in a Primary School building. Shortly, thereafter a
                temporary Church Extension Building was erected on a
                piece of property purchased by the Extension Board. We
                had about ten families when we started. Some were
                members of the First United Methodist Church that lived
                closer to us. They became the nucleus of the beginning
                Church. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">To back up in
                time; near the end of my associate days at First Church.
                Another child was born into the Mc Ginnis family, her
                name was Kerry Leigh. Mark had a little sister, he was
                no longer the baby of the family, now a big brother, the
                elder child. This new addition temporarily cured Bab's
                despondency and boredom, but only off and on. The
                usual&nbsp;barbs and jabs, the hostilities, the anger at
                times was always waiting in the wings. To appear at the
                most disquieting of times. What infuriated Babs the
                most, I believe, was that I refused to join the fray. I
                would not play the game. I do not have a doubt in my
                mind that because I was raised in that sort of an
                atmosphere. I was" sicken unto death" to become part of
                the same syndrome. Plus, I was always conscious, always
                aware that, " little pitchers have big ears." No child,
                should be subjected to such behavior on the part of his
                or her parents. Because some children carry the scars
                all their lives. And cannot shake them for whatever
                reasons, the strife and conflict, grew more strident and
                acrimonious. Of all times, it came to a head during the
                'Christmas Season', a Season in which you would least
                expect it. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Bab's parents
                had come in from Houston for a visit, during the
                Holidays. It was evident to them, that something was
                wrong, it was in the air. Their were irreconcilable
                (there's' that word again) differences, that never ever
                really left our 11 year relationship, from that day when
                the words rang out:" I don't want to be a minister's
                wife. You chose to become a minister. I didn't."</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The Marriage
                was over, Babs, I am sure, never thought there would be
                a divorce. Because a second divorce would ruin me in the
                Ministry. And she had counted on this, to stop any
                thought of a divorce. But when a marriage is over and "
                the fat lady has sung " it is over. And "all the King's
                men, can't put it back together again". For me to live
                my life out, for the children to live their life out, in
                a marriage that is treading water all the time, barely
                keeping its' head above the waterline. Is a
                non-productive, a non-conducive situation; if it isn't
                good for all the parties concerned, it needs to be
                buried. Work through the trauma, or the grief or
                whatever, and get on with living. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The minute,
                the 'powers to be', learned about the up and coming
                divorce proceedings. I was released from the Ministry of
                'Richland United Methodist Church' and put on hold. My
                Congregation signed a petition to persuade the Bishop to
                reinstate me, but he would have no part of it. We were
                just a beginning Church, and there was no doubt, that
                since I was one of the first of the brethren to be
                divorced. He, the Bishop was going to make a point, a
                statement. There were no charges of theft, adultery,
                blasphemy or heresy. No grounds for a trial, I had to be
                re-instated. I was called into the Bishop's office, just
                before the June appointment time. Both the Bishop and
                the District Superintendent, said I should resigned and
                leave the ministry. That my divorce was a black mark
                against the Ministry. And by example, I portrayed a bad
                image as to the sanctity of marriage. And that if I
                insisted on staying in the Ministry; they, the Bishop
                and the District Superintendent would ship me, to the
                furthest point in the Conference, which they did come
                June Appointments. They also said, that appointing an
                unmarried divorced man, would be a problem. I might have
                to wait until the following year for an appointment. But
                I had anticipated this might happen, to block my
                appointment. And when I said, I will be married by
                Conference time, you could see the wind go out of their
                sails. On that note I turned and left the office. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Well, come
                Conference Time, I was married to <strong><span
                    style="color: #cc0000;">Ceci</span></strong>, who
                had three lovely daughters, Janet, Julia and Linda. We
                all moved to Kemp, Texas, and yes, it was the furthest
                point in the North Texas Conference, a two point circuit
                charge, Kemp and the Becker United Methodist Church,
                Becker was about a fifteen minute drive. We stayed in
                Kemp, the Parsonage was new and quite adequate. Ceci,
                was a very effervescent person, one who people liked on
                contact. She was a trained vocalist, a beautiful voice
                and had done professional work in Musicals. She also
                played the piano. Her greatest asset, was her
                disposition; she was a "up" person, who was seldom down.
                We had no great problems, a little difference in the
                handling of the youngest girl, Janet, who was a charmer
                but precocious at times. We had a good Ministry, it was
                an easy Ministry. My immediate challenge, was to get new
                blood into the Church. Some younger couples with
                children. And to get the Church painted. The Becker
                United Methodist Church, in Becker, was basically a
                family church, Mr. George Becker was the main financial
                support for the Church. Maybe ten persons on a Sunday
                morning, most in their sixties or above. The Church
                would remain as long as George was alive. We stayed in
                Kemp for three years, both of the older girls became
                married, while we were in Kemp. Ceci was a Mary Kay
                Cosmetic Consultant, this was her outlet. Plus, for a
                while she did some part time legal secretarial work for
                a Law firm in Mabank. She was multi-talented.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">From time to
                time, she contributed several articles to the local
                papers in the area. She was an excellent features
                writer, that is how we met. She did an article in the
                Richardson Newspaper, about 'Richland United Methodist
                Church'. After&nbsp;my divorce, I ran into her and we
                talked; she said, "how sorry she was to hear that I was
                no longer at the Church", that was it. Then one day, I
                called the Newspaper office and asked her out on a date.
                One thing led to another and before either of us
                realized it, we were seeing each other more and more. We
                decided to get married instead of living in the big "S".
                In Texas there is a waiting period between marriages but
                we crossed over into Oklahoma and were married by a
                Justice of The Peace, who called himself "Marrying
                Sam.", who had actually played the part in a Broadway
                Production of "Li'l Abner". This all happened just
                before Conference time. I informed the Bishop that I had
                gotten married.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">In the last
                year, while I was in Kemp, Bishop Pope retired. And the
                North Texas Conference received a new Bishop. Bishop
                McPheron Stowe, plucked me out of Kemp, come appointment
                time in June. I was sent to Henrietta, Texas, a County
                seat Town, in the Wichita Falls District. Just Ceci,
                Janet and I, the two older girls were married. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">This Church,
                had changed Ministers faster than a 'Catwalk Model' can
                change her clothes. They were delinquent in their
                apportionment's each year. They hadn't raised the
                Pastors' salary in nine years. The growth had been
                negligible. And there were very few young people in the
                Church. No new blood. There was also a strong power
                structure that held the Church back. And an inbreeding
                on the Board, husbands and wives serving and switching
                jobs each year, controlling the Board. It was their
                Church, they pulled the strings. Well, needless to say,
                things got sticky. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">The Church
                does not belong to a power click, to but a few. The
                Church is the Priesthood of all believers. It is of God,
                for the glory of God, not for any one group, or single
                individual. The Methodist Church, is not the Baptist
                church.&nbsp; It is not some isolated autonomous Bible
                Church, that peddles the Cooks', or the Navigators', or
                the Crusade for Christ Literature. A Methodist Church is
                a Methodist Church, the Members cannot ignore the
                tenets, nor the Discipline of the Methodist Church and
                it's protocol. When one becomes a member of the
                Methodist Church, they stand before God and the other
                members of the that Church. And say, to the questions
                asked," Yes." or " I will." </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I was there
                for two years, a two year uphill battle, a lesson in
                futility and patience. I was re-appointed for the third
                year. I returned to the Church. But shortly thereafter,
                I voluntarily resigned in&nbsp;the second week, in June
                of '76. While Ceci was visiting her parents in Indiana.
                I had violated my vows to both the Church and my wife. I
                could not stay with either one of them in good
                conscience. The reasons for my transgression are not
                important, nor would be the words. It happened, it just
                happened. I will not defend myself or my actions. That
                was twenty-three years ago and I still regret my
                actions. That had never happened before or since, nor
                will it happen again. But this is of no consolation, nor
                does it right the wrong. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">I settled in
                Dallas, became involved with a lady, her name was Dede.
                Dede was twenty-five, I was zeroing in on the
                half-century mark. Truly a winter/spring relationship,
                it lasted seven years. No marriage involved. Eventually
                we separated, she wanted something different, which she
                got. We parted friends, which she
                denied&nbsp;twenty-five years later.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">On August 28,
                1983, I left the Dallas area to walk the 50 States of
                America. In February of 1987, I finished. I was in
                Hawaii, my 50th. State. I flew back to the
                States,&nbsp;landed at the San Diego Airport, in
                California. I was expecting a long legged <span
                  style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Elle</strong></span>
                to meet me at the Airport. We had met in El Cajon, prior
                to my leaving for Hawaii. We had corresponded and talked
                on the phone, while I was trying to secure a passage to
                Hawaii. No Elle, I went to the Baggage Counter to
                pick-up my backpack. Just as I was getting ready to
                leave, I spotted Elle, she spotted me, and like a film
                clip, we ran into each others' arms. She thought she had
                missed me. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">After Elle's
                divorce, we lived together for a while. But eventually
                we thought it would be best, for her children's sake, to
                get married. A joint custody for the children was
                established, one month with the father, one month with
                the mother. Whoever thought this one up, never lived it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">It&nbsp;is a
                "three ring circus", for the child or the children and
                for the parents. And should there be step-parents or a
                step-parent involved, forget it. If the parents' hands
                are tied because of this arrangement, the step-parents'
                becomes even more so. He or she is bound and gagged. You
                just stand him/her up in the corner, and if anybody
                should ask, " who is that?". The kid can reply, "oh,
                that is somebody my mother married". You become about as
                useless as teats on a brass cow. I hope by now that
                California has changed this procedure. It is a "no win"
                situation, the children play one parent over and against
                the other parent. If both households have different
                rules, different ways of doing things, the children have
                no continuity. And of course the children, have fun and
                games. The inmates start running the asylum. The parents
                are not in control, the children dictate the terms. This
                arrangement becomes ideal for a blackmail situation; "If
                I don't get to do what I want to do here, I will go live
                with dad. Or vice versa. And you will never see me
                again." No child or teenager, should be allowed to
                blackmail their parent and get away with it. Both
                parents need to fight this before it gets out of hand.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Poor Elle was
                caught in the middle. She felt guilty over the divorce,
                along with thinking maybe that she had been selfish,
                thinking only about her needs and not the children's.
                This intensified her inner guilt. So when it came time
                for some decisiveness, having to do with a disruptive
                behavior problem, it was easier to acquiesce, and hope
                it would just go away on its' own. Confrontation meant
                losing the children, because they had the option, or the
                blackmail threat to go live with their father. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Of course
                what the father should have said to the children, "I
                will not allow you to blackmail your mother. If you use
                those tactics, you are not welcome in this house". Here
                we are talking about the strength of parenting. The
                children cannot write the rules, the children cannot
                become the parents. And the parents become the children.
                Once the child backs the parent down, the parent is no
                longer a parent. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">When parents
                after a divorce situation allow the children or the
                child to do what they want, so they can gain favor with
                them, or so they will like staying with them better than
                staying with the other parent, they are doing a grave
                injustice to the child or children, and to the present
                household if there are step-parents involved. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Elle was
                between the rock and the hard place, after five years.
                She made the choice. She wanted out, she wanted her
                freedom. But also in the latter days, to be free from
                the guilt and the deception she was living with day by
                day. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial;;">Like in the
                long ago that same eerie feeling; there was someone else
                in the house with us. What a shame, the timing was
                off... The relationship would probably have lasted. It
                was never a matter of loving one another, it was the
                circumstances. I left for Dublin, Ireland on March 17,
                1992, to finish the rest of the World... </span></p>
