            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>&nbsp;Six

              pairs of both Nike and&nbsp;New Balance for the
              Fifty-&nbsp;State walk.&nbsp; For the World Walk (eight
              pairs) of Gore-Tex&nbsp; hiking boots {Scarpa.}&nbsp; The
              most important piece of equipment I own are&nbsp;my Hiking
              Boots.</p>
            <p>If you are going to hike for any considerable distance on
              a day by day basis; a good hiking boot is essential along
              with a good fit. And if you are going to carry a
              substantial amount of weight in your backpack. You need a
              boot that will give you the proper support for your ankles
              and your arches.</p>
            <p>And should you decide to walk through all the Seasons. In
              all types of weather, it would not be a bad idea to have a
              pair of boots that are waterproofed. There is nothing more
              miserable than to be splattering around in wet soggy
              boots.</p>

              At this point you become a diplomat. "I haven't been there
              yet". But really one cannot equate countries. It is unfair
              to compare one Country over an against another Country.
              There are to many variables.</p>
            <p><em>Along with above question, comes a similar question:</em>&nbsp;<img
                src="images/ques.gif" alt="question" border="0"
                width="14" height="20" align="left"><span style="color:
                #cc6600;"><strong>Where is the most beautiful place in
                  the world?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Answer:</span></strong>
              Usually, I ask the group that I am speaking to: "How would
              you answer that question?" The saying is true, that
              'beauty is in the eyes of the beholder'. What strikes a
              responsive chord in one person, may or may not appeal to
              someone else, exactly in the same way. As one cynic
              retorted: "There is no excuse for some peoples' taste".</p>
            <p><img src="images/ques.gif" alt="question" border="0"
                width="14" height="20" align="left"><span style="color:
                #cc6600;"><strong>Don't you ever get lonely?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>
              Sure I do. especially in those times as I watch people;
              being with their families, seeing lovers, hand in hand,
              watching children play or observing many of the other
              noticeable relationships. Then we have all the holidays
              that cause the memories to flood the mind. There are so
              many things that can trigger the mind to remind us of both
              the good and the bad times. But in truth; loneliness is a
              state of mind. If one learns the art of being alone one
              need not be lonely. Loneliness in most instances is the
              out come of dependence. I am aware that I cannot afford to
              allow reminiscent moments to mushroom into a full blown
              soliloquy of "lonely me", or "woe is me". Neither of these
              are conducive or productive for the completion of "The
              Walk". Which will be finished&nbsp; unless my time is cut
              short due to lack of oxygen or some other
              malfunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>

                width="14" height="20" align="left"><span style="color:
                #cc6600;"><strong>Do you ever get bored?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p align="left">I am not a person who gets bored easily. It
              is not in my nature, I have to many interests and I
              thoroughly, honestly love living. I am too active,
              competitive and curious. And secondly, on a walk such as
              this how could anyone get tired of seeing and hearing the
              multiplicity of sights and sounds that the World offers up
              each breathing and waking second. When I awaken each
              morning I haven't the foggiest idea as to what the day
              might bring; who I might meet, what I might encounter down
              the road around the corner or over the hill. Maybe a man,
              a child, a woman or even a beast. Or a sight that would
              stagger the imagination, or make an artists' palette
              blush. Leaving one speechless.</p>
            The serendipity of this walk is beyond all logic, all
            sequential linear thought , all words and certainly beyond
            the pale of any and all expectation. How privileged am I
            amid all these surprises and happenings. For all this and
            more is out there, just waiting for us to say; "yes" to life
            and enter its' flow and its' calling; "the waters fine, jump
            in"
            <p><img src="images/ques.gif" alt="question" border="0"
                width="14" height="20" align="left"><a name="6"></a><span
                style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Are you not afraid of
                  the animals attacking you?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p>I usually say to groups, "I promise not to bite the
              animals if they will not bite me". Animals are in most
              cases more scared of you than you should be of them. But I
              would quickly add that animals in their own territory are
              not stuffed toys. You need to respect all animals and take
              care when you are on their turf.</p>
            <p>There are certain things one needs to do when you are in
              and around where animals might be. Do not go near their
              offspring. All female animals are protectors of their
              young, so stay a good distance from them. Do not go near
              an animal while they are eating, they may change their
              menu. Or while they are stalking especially if you happen
              to be the stalk-ee. Do not make any sudden moves or
              gestures and do not run. Even though your pounding heart
              says "run for your life." The predators can match every
              move you can make. And they can out-run you. If you have
              no line of defense, I suggest you pray that the earth will
              just open up and swallow you.</p>
            <p>But seriously, the chances of you being eaten by a lion
              or a tiger are unlikely. What is more likely is being run
              over by a car.</p>
            <p>I carry with me a twelve foot long bullwhip which I have
              used on three hyenas who got to close for comfort. But the
              most effective thing I carry to use against animals are
              firecrackers and a good dependable lighter. It has done
              the trick on more than one occasion.</p>
            <p><img src="images/ques.gif" alt="question" border="0"
                width="14" height="20" align="left"><a name="7"></a><span
                style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Have you ever been
                  robbed or attacked by someone?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p>There have been attempts to rob me. And yes, I have been
              attacked. I have had&nbsp;eight physical encounters. And
              out of the eight I have been down once. Ending up with one
              very large headache. I was blindsided with a hefty staff
              while fending off two others in front of me. Luckily, as
              they say; "the cavalry came just in time". Actually, it
              was a group of soldiers that fired shots in the air.</p>
            <p>From an encounter in Algeria, I have a souvenir, a knife
              wound on my right forearm. But I must add quickly, that
              eight attacks stretched over a 20 year period of being
              exposed in 70 countries plus&nbsp;is, minimal. And as far
              as I am concerned this speaks highly of the human race. We
              are not "going to Hell in a hand basket", as the
              soothsayers of doom and gloom would have us to believe.</p>
            <p>Of course one of the problems; good news does not sell
              nor does it increase your ratings. But the "bad and the
              ugly" does increase circulation and ratings. Now that we
              are able to cover the Globe with instant communication. We
              are bombarded day and night with the worst of scenarios
              and the worst side of human nature. What a shame that
              equal time is not given to the other side of; who we are.
              Oh, I forgot it doesn't sell.</p>
            <p>Tell me, how many out of the&nbsp;7 billion plus people
              we have on this spinning globe will do all the things we
              see or read about daily? Would you guess, a 100 million or
              500 million or how about a billion? This still
              leaves&nbsp;6&nbsp; billion persons that are reasonably
              sane, notwithstanding those with a few bolts and nuts
              missing.</p>
            <p>Can or do things happen because of a minority, a very
              small group of misguided individuals. Yes! But that leaves
              99.9% okay! in a manner of speaking.</p>
            Why are we so pessimistic, so cynical and negative. Is it
            because so many of the critics don't like themselves so we
            have a little transference going on; Yes?

                style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>What do you eat?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;First off, I eat to live, I do not live to eat. My
              diet on this walk is fairly Spartan. After a days' walking
              I find a suitable place to put up my tent for the night
              and then go about preparing something for supper. I carry
              a seven day supply of food, which can be stretched if the
              need arises. My staples are: flour, cooking oil, sugar,
              salt and pepper, oatmeal, peanut butter, rice and pasta. I
              try not to carry canned foods because of the weight
              factor. Although I will pick up some canned meat or tuna
              if I am going to use it that night. I also pick up some
              fresh veggies and fruit along the way.</p>
            <p>Having been in&nbsp;70 countries, I have tried most of
              the ethnic dishes of those countries at least once. That
              does not mean that I always finish them, but I make the
              attempt. I have eaten so many things most of which I can't
              even pronounce their names. Nor do I always know what I am
              eating which is probably better than knowing.</p>
            <p>When I am walking in between countries my personal weight
              is around 170 to 180 lb. When inertia sets in even for a
              short time, I can put on ten or fifteen pounds in a wink.
              In the towns and the cities I make up for my one pot
              cooking in the bush.</p>
            I have said many times to the groups I am speaking too; that
            when this walk is finished and I return back to the States,
            I will probably pull a rickshaw and sing opera because of
            all the rice and pasta I have eaten.

                style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>How do you finance your
                  walk?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>
              This World Walk is financed through two sources; one is a
              Social Security benefit which every working American pays
              into while he is employed until he or she retires. After
              which upon reaching 65 years of age, he or she can start
              collecting a percentage of the monies that have been paid
              in.</p>
            <p>And the second source of money comes from a World War II
              disability benefit. My total allotment from both sources
              is $900.00 per month. The only possessions I have in this
              World I carry in my backpack. I am indeed free but more
              than that I have accumulated an inner wealth over the
              last&nbsp;80 years that no amount money can ever buy.</p>
            <p>I have been asked if I&nbsp;work along the way.&nbsp; No,
              I have never had too. Although I have been instrumental in
              helping new businesses get started; New Hostels,
              Restaurants and the founding of "English Corners"
              (conversational English) all over the World.&nbsp; In the
              restaurants&nbsp;if the employees do not speak English,
              especially the waiters and the Chef&nbsp;where they are
              serving Western Food. I offer to teach&nbsp;them
              English,&nbsp;my services our&nbsp;free. It's a lot of
              fun.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Someone, after a speaking engagement to a Business
                group of professionals, came up and said "What will the
                words which you have spoken? Get you on the open
                market?"</p>
              <p>My reply was: I see you are suffering from gout. Am I
                right? And also your eyes are growing dim. What would
                you give of that which you possess to get rid of your
                dis-ease and be well in your eyes again. And also in
                your spirit? What would you give?</p>
              <p>After a pause, "most of it, I guess" was his reply.</p>
              <p>You believe I have nothing. Where I believe I have been
                given all the gifts and graces of "all and everything".
                For, I am aware of all the breathing and aliveness that
                surrounds me. The very&nbsp;breath which I have been
                given; this Creative Breath of Life is part of
                everything above and below. "All and Everything"&nbsp;is
                connected by this Thread of Breath.</p>
              <p>Yours and my existence hangs by this very thread. And
                if this thread should break for one of us as we speak.
                Tell me what would you give if yours was to break? To
                have it mended, reconnected. Most or all of that which
                you own? What would you give?</p>
              <p>What would you give if you could not see a sunrise
                again or the smiles of the ones you love? Or see the
                Seasons change or the birth of your next child? What
                would you give if you could not hear the sounds of Life
                around you? The song of the birds, the wind and the rain
                or a word of love. What would you give? Tell me!</p>
              <p>He said nothing, but as he was walking away, he
                stopped, turned and smiled.</p>
              <p>I received my honorarium, in that smile.</p>

                  you have an accident?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
            <p>This trek has been relatively free of both illnesses and
              accidents. Within this walk, give or take a pain here and
              there. I don't spend time worrying about becoming ill.</p>
            <p>In fact I have been blessed throughout my life with good
              health. Going years without any thing of a serious nature.
              My weakness has always been in the respiratory area. As
              was predicted when I was born at seven months. The
              physician in charge thought possibly in later life I would
              be troubled with upper respiratory problems. And he was
              right, double pneumonia four times. Once when I was very
              young and three times in the service.</p>
            <p>Then came 1959, a bout with tuberculosis. That had a
              miraculous recovery. Moved from a positive culture with
              three open cavities to a negative culture in seven days.
              With the cavities closing over a two month period. I was
              put on a new drug therapy upon entering St.Joseph's
              hospital in Houston, Texas; that had just been approved by
              the FDA ( PAS and a couple of other new drugs) I had none
              of the usual tubercular symptoms; weight loss, low grade
              fever, a hacking cough or the sputum. I felt "on top of
              the heap" all the time while they were trying to tell
              me&nbsp;I was sick. I was in the V.A. Hospital for eight
              months. Since that period until now I have been home free.</p>
            <p>But recently, I found out in Capetown after a P.S.A. test
              and a biopsy I have a little "c". At the present he, she
              or it and I are at a "Mexican standoff". I have been told
              that I will probably not die of cancer at my age. I'll die
              of something else maybe "ichthyosaurs" because of my early
              Catholic fish Fridays. To operate at this time could cause
              it to spread faster. Once again, I have no other symptoms
              besides a dribble here and a dribble there, a start here
              and a stop there. Old Mac Donald had a farm. eei, eei,
              oooo. And on his farm, he had.... You know the song. The
              prostate is just a glitch!</p>
            <p>The irony lies in the fact that at my birth there was a
              struggle between life and death. Now it seems I have come
              full circle. Life and death have me in the middle once
              again. But as has been my disposition in life, I accept
              the challenge. We will make it a race to the finish line.
              The finish line in this scenario being the border between
              Mexico and Texas. In the year 2010, or thereabouts. Don' t
              you just love a challenge. Let the race begin.</p>
            <p>As the song goes; " Into each life some rain must fall."
              While another song says; "That's Life " But as I was
              taught early in life " this too, shall pass." We cannot
              control many of the unforeseen circumstances that befall
              us. But what we can control is how we pro-act, not re-act
              to the particular circumstance at hand. Our frame of mind,
              our posturing, our attitude. all these are important and
              vital for our recovery. Out of whatever it might be. These
              we can control!</p>
            <p>Such words as; "can't, impossible, or no hope" violates
              the human spirit. And since we know so little about the
              mind, body and spirit flow chart and the existing
              potentially of these three inter-related entities, we
              should never underestimate the "Will and the Power" that
              lies within.</p>
            <p>I need to remind myself daily by affirming to myself that
              I am not my thoughts, I am more than my thoughts. And this
              holds true for my emotions, my feelings and my physical
              functions.</p>
            <p>I have been "Imaged and Imprinted" out of THE WILL and
              the POWER of said WILL. Which is seminal for " All and
              Everything ." And out of this seed I have the possibility
              to consciously choose and act. To decide and do that which
              is the more excellent. To choose those affirmations which
              allows one to be what they were created to become and be.
              And always have been.</p>
            <p>"We have been given everything we need. We but need to
              experience everything we have been given".</p>
            <p>Choose your semantics or your preferences then become and
              be them, if you see that you are in balance and in harmony
              with " all and everything". "You have chosen well,
              grasshopper". If this be not the case. No problem; just
              reprogram, reprogram. You have been given all the tools,
              the gifts and graces to become and be&nbsp;what you need
              to become and be, what you can be. So go for "the gold".
              Just do it.</p>
            <p>{Update 2006}</p>
            <p><a href="ppp/p-health.html">Health Report</a>:</p>
            <p>My PSI has dropped from a {4.2} to a {3.2} level. Why? no
              one seems to know. My Prostate trouble seems to be
              'running in place". I am guessing that&nbsp;the prognosis
              was an error.</p>
            <p>In the Year 2005 between Christmas and New Years', I was
              bed-ridden, I could not walk. I shuffled in and out of bed
              at the appropriate times. I mumbled and groaned like a
              wounded bear. I have no illusions that I am&nbsp;possibly
              the Worlds' worst patient when it comes to being confined.
              This went on for about a month with interval visits to a
              osteopath at a Army Hospital [China}. Fortunately he had
              been trained at the Mayo Clinic in America. His final
              suggestion was that I needed a disk replacement between
              the fourth and fifth lumbar section of my spine. The disk
              had deteriorated causing the sciatic and other nerve
              problems. The bottom line I needed an operation. My reply
              was, "no way, Jose! "I asked if&nbsp;there&nbsp;were other
              alternatives? A different way to solve the problem? He
              suggested 'Physical Therapy' and a set of exercises for
              the back and the abdominal. He said; if I could establish
              strong core&nbsp;muscles for my back and stomach the spine
              might be held in place. I said; "lets' do it". Through a
              body building program with specific emphasis on the back
              and the abdominals. I am walking again and playing tennis
              again.</p>
            <p>The rain has left and the sun is shinning brightly. How
              sweet it is!</p>
            <p>{Here, let me add a note}</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that we of the human species have been
              given three of the greatest gifts of all time.&nbsp;
              Miraculous gifts that allows us to travel through this
              time and space; to see and enjoy the thousands of other
              miracles that are offered up on a moment by moment basis.
              The &nbsp;"Gifts"; <em>Body, Mind and Spirit.</em></p>
            <p>Since a large portion of this web-site
              already&nbsp;contains much about&nbsp;the gifts of the <em>Mind/Spirit
              </em>miracles. Allow a few words&nbsp;about the collection
              of the 10,000 trillion citizens{cells} that we travel with
              through time and space. That goes on day in and day out
              within the walls of our bodies&nbsp;allowing us to
              interact with "all and everything". Which should remind us
              that we are truly a&nbsp;walking, talking,
              breathing&nbsp;wonder of this "Cosmos"&nbsp;which we have
              inherited.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Of course the question that needs to be ask; "how is it
              that the human race falls into such a malaise, a lethargic
              stupor that makes&nbsp;life so meaningless so "blah"? That
              just existing&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;a daily fare, an existence
              where there are no exit signs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Even though their bonds and chains are invisible,
              they are enslaved. Caught-up in a never ending; "same-o,
              same-o! Oblivious to the wonders and challenges of the
              flow of Life.</p>
            <p>They are indeed&nbsp;the "Walking dead"</p>
