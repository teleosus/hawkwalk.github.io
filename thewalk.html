                  align="right">After completing the fifty states in the
                1980s at fifty-six years of age.&nbsp;Hawk set out to
                take on the world, a solo odyssey that began
                in&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;in 1992 when he was sixty-five
                years old.</span></p>
            <p><span>Some&nbsp;70&nbsp;countries and 19 years later,
                Hawk is now in&nbsp;South America&nbsp; Even though
                there have been a number of harrowing experiences, the
                walk is to be finished in the year 2012, back in
                Houston,Tx. Give or take a year here and there.</span></p>
            <p><span>The trip had its' genesis from a&nbsp;seven year
                old boy's dream of seeing and hearing the sights and
                sounds out of the pages of the National Geographic
                magazine and the adventure movies of a bygone era.</span></p>
            <p>After the fifty state walk, the hawk called a time out
              and became married with the belief that his new bride
              would accompany him on the walk around the world. But
              alas! 'the best laid plans of mice and men, oft go
              astray.' The brides' "boots were not made for walking."</p>
            <p>On March 16, 1992, Hawk flew
              to&nbsp;Dublin&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;to march in the St.
              Patrick's Day Parade,&nbsp;divorce papers in hand (Happy
              St Patrick's Day?).&nbsp;After&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;came the
              rest of the World. And the passing&nbsp;of 20 years. </p>
            <p><span>This lean, six-foot, two inch former Methodist
                Minister carries a 100 pound backpack.&nbsp;<img

                  align="left">Sort of a home away from home, with
                everything but the kitchen sink; well almost everything.</span></p>
            <p><span>His night camping could almost be anywhere. Along
                the side of the road, on pool tables, in church foyers,
                parks, campsites, villages, the bush or a cozy bed
                furnished by a gracious host In the cities, Hawk returns
                to a more gregarious setting; dining out, sleeping in
                beds, playing a little tennis, movies, dancing and a
                little R&amp;R. But in between the R&amp;R breaks, it is
                rice and pasta time, in a one pot cooking system.</span></p>
            <p><span>For protection, Hawk wields a six-foot walking
                staff, tipped with steel at both ends which he made
                prior to his walk around the fifty-states. Plus two
                balanced throwing knifes, a custom made Bowie Knife
                (Blackie Collins) and a twelve foot bullwhip. From time
                to time; they have had to be used.</span></p>
            <p>In Algeria , two Islamic militants screaming "Allah"
              appeared wielding a stick and a knife. A couple slaps to
              the head ended the attack. But in Asyut , Egypt , Hawk was
              not as lucky, where another militant knocked him to the
              ground with a stick while he was fending off two others in
              front of him. Luckily the soldiers arrived just in time,
              as he was fading into unconsciousness. In Sudan, when the
              authorities held him for three days in Wadi Hafa, the
              staff was of little help.</p>
            <p>Walking staff in hand and often wearing a denim jacket
              with his Logo on the back of it, Mr. Hawk is very
              noticeable in the bustling cities of the world, where he
              is often asked "Are you that man walking around the world?
              Could I have your autograph?"</p>
            <p>Throughout his life, Hawk has rarely stayed put for too
              long. Born in Indiana , he enlisted in the Army to fight
              in World War II; he was discharged from the Army in
              Okinawa, April 1947. Since the war; he has been a
              Professional Big Band singer,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Photographer
              Assistant in Hollywood , a¨Dude Ranch Manager in Las
              Vegas, a Managing Editor of a Television magazine
              (Televiews) in Houston ,Texas. His last profession,
              a&nbsp;Methodist Minister in the ´North Texas Conference´.
              He left the Ministry after fifteen years of service.</p>
            <p>Mr. McGinnis has been married and divorced
              four&nbsp;times and has three children&nbsp;six
              grandchildren.&nbsp;And a great grandson. When asked about
              his divorces? He replies; "I am a slow learner."&nbsp; His
              last marriage was to a CPA, the one who was going to walk
              around the World with him. Whom he met on his "Walk"
              around the United States between 1983 and 1987. He lived
              with her for five years in San Diego before leaving on his
              Global trek.</p>
            <p>Though today, organized religion is not his cup of tea,
              Hawk remains very spiritual and intense. Intense is an
              understatement which partially explains Hawks' motivation.
              On his calling card, he has printed. Needed dimensions of
              a seeker...<strong>."desire, discipline, determination,
                discrimination and detachment". T</strong>he card also
              carries the proposed title of a possible forthcoming book,
              after he returns in the year 2012, give or take a year or
              two.</p>
            <p>For Hawk this dream walk is an outward and an inward
              pilgrimage. By nature he is a philosopher. Who believes
              that most people consciously or unconsciously are
              searching for answers to three
              quintessential&nbsp;questions: <strong>"Who am I?" "Why
                am I here?" And "where Am I going?"</strong></p>
