                Opening Statement:</b>
              <p>One needs to remind oneself that a collection of words,
                facts or figures, whether they be spoken or written,
                cannot begin to catch all the nuances, the thoughts,
                feelings and the emotions of a person caught-up in a
                moment of existence, of experiencing. </p>
              <p>Once again this was proven as I descended, Mt.
                Kilimanjaro. When a young man on his way up asked; "how
                was it at the top? " My reply was "you will know only
                when you get there". </p>
              <p>To name something, does not explain it. Anymore than we
                are able to interpret, to capture or reduce the spirit,
                the very core, the "Thus-ness" of anything by
                classifying, categorizing or cataloguing it. </p>
              <p>Whatever our senses or mental processes might offer up
                to us at any given moment. Are but mere re-presentations
                which we have filtered and diminished, in and through
                the realities, we have personally structured for
                ourselves. Or that we have allowed to be structured for
                us. And if not structured for us. They; someone or
                something has undoubtedly affected our windows of
                perception. </p>
              <p>We may; assume, surmise, assess, evaluate, interpret
                and analyze another's' thoughts, feelings, emotions,
                reactions or pro-actions. And then say "it seems
                like..., it looks like..., it could or might be". But in
                reality we may never really know the intrinsic spirit of
                another person. And in a way, this is sad and what makes
                this knowing about someone even more difficult is that
                we as individuals have a sketchy picture of who and what
                we are as ourselves, the world and the things of the
                world are all about. . </p>
              <div>How many of us take the time to ask ourselves; "who
                am I?, why am I here?, and what am I to be about?" The
                more Self-knowledge, the more Self-understanding, we
                have of ourselves. Then "<i>Becoming and Being"</i> can
                become a possibility. Becoming and "Being" who and what
                we were created to be. Although paradoxically; we are
                always what we were created to be. The problem: We have
                forgotten our "Ultimate Nature", we have betrayed our
                heritage. We have opted out for a second-handed nature,
                a false identity.</div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>Someone who was about to be interviewed on camera
                remarked that they "didn't think they could do the
                interview" And the cameraman replied "Sure you can, just
                be yourself". Easier said than done, when we are not to
                sure as to who we really are... Why we we are here? And
                what it is all about, anyway ?</div>
              <p>We each have a note to play. If one chooses not to
                become and be their note. Their music dies with them,
                never to be heard. How sad ! We are the music while it
                lasts. So we need to join the symphony of life. And
                maybe add a new note to the arrangement.

              <p><font color="#cc6600"><b>Let The Self- Remembering
                    Begin:</b></font> </p>
              <p>Born on August 28th, 1927, a seven month old preemie;
                "Life and Death" were caught in a struggle... But a
                "Providential" smile prevailed and Harry Lee Mc Ginnis
                kept the breath of life. That day of days, a survivor
                said; "Hello, World, I am here." The "Will" touched two
                lives that day, mother and son. </p>
              <p>The young child's' early battle with death and winning,
                set the stage for all his future difficulties and
                obstacles. The "Will" to overcome, to survive come what
                may. Which we will see later on. </p>
              <p>Life was far from being the proverbial "bowl of
                cherries" for the young survivor. Nor was it; for many
                of the other children of the "Great Depression" era in
                America during the the early thirties. Jobs were scarce
                and food at times even more so. </p>
              <p>Unemployment and scarcity does strange things to the
                mind, body and spirit. It seems to magnify the
                weaknesses and the proclivities of human nature. Making
                us less than we are in most cases. Although for others,
                it seems to have a reverse effect. It strengthens
                instead of weakening, challenges instead of defeating;
                giving birth to a fighter, one who will survive. "<i>Come
                  hell or high water".</i> </p>
              <p>During the formative years of this young warrior, there
                were the good and the not so good role models. For
                unfortunately, Martha's (the mother) track record for
                choosing potential husbands and fathers left much to be
                desired. Between the first one and the fifth one; one
                might say her bittersweet relationships were a "comedy
                of errors". </p>
              <p>Drunkenness and its' side-kick abusiveness both verbal
                and physical, along with jealousy and possessiveness.
                Each raged with a constant barrage of language that
                would make even a sailor blush. Surely this is not what
                any child needs. I could never understand as I watched
                and listened; how two people who professed to love each
                other could destroy one another mentally, physically and
                spiritually. </p>
              <p>For the last part of my formative years; I saw the
                devastation, listened to the pathetic repetitive
                apologies and promises, the recriminations, accusations,
                the lying, the broken commitments, the ceaseless
                arguments, disrespect along with the constant
                de-humanizing. All; which created for me an ever present
                portrait of human indignities and frailties that just
                hung there; like a dead albatross around my neck.
                Staring up with its deadness and despair. </p>
              <p>But up out of these ashes like the Phoenix, grew a
                child, a young man, an adult who believed that life was
                more, much more than the old portrait that portrayed all
                the opposites. And that there existed outside the chaos,
                beyond the walls of discord and tears; a hope, another
                life. A life that gave life, instead of one that buried
                it, </p>
              <p>It was 1939. On Hawk's 12 th. birthday, a small book
                was placed in his hand. Given to him by a basketball
                coach (Bill Puckett) of a YMCA team which Hawk was
                playing on. The Title of the book was <b>As A Man
                  Thinketh</b> by James Allen. Out of the "seed
                thoughts" from that small book came many blossoms and
                fruits which gave Hawk the beginnings for all his future
                seeking and searching. </p>
              <p>The words that found root and became nurtured; said to
                the effect; "we can either allow weeds to grow in our
                garden. Or we can choose and plant those seeds which
                gives us flowers". Choice is the name of the game.
                "CHOICE" what a gift!. These words started "The Quest"
                for the young Hawk. The Way back; a return to his
                earliest beginnings, before "time and space" was and now
                is. </p>
              <p>This boy-man quit High School in his Junior year and
                ran off to the big {W.W. II}, to fight in a foreign land
                far across the sea. Against an enemy he had never seen
                or knew. He was trained to kill or be killed. He knew
                but in a way he didn't know or quite understand the
                reason for killing someone he had never met. But he
                learned and learned it well; the needed discipline and
                the "esprit de corp". of the Military. As to what he had
                to do and how to do it. The metamorphosis took place a
                boy became a man. But surely, there is a more humane
                way. </p>
              <p>On April 21, 1947, Hawk was discharged at Oakland,
                California, after landing in San Francisco Bay. He had
                sailed from Okinawa, then to the Philippines where he
                was first stationed overseas, and then home. </p>
              <p>From Oakland, Hawk made his way back to Albany, New
                York. His re-union was short and sweet, a drunk was in
                the house; husband number five. Hawk moved out. During
                the rest of 1947 up to December of 1949, Hawk worked two
                jobs, one in the morning and one in the evening. He sang
                with a Combo at the Ten Eyck Hotel in Albany and also at
                the Henderson Hotel in Troy. During the day he sold
                shoes at A.S. Beck shoe store for ladies. At times
                driving taxis, selling magazines for Crowell Collier,
                Wearever Cookware, Britannica Encyclopedias and the
                Great Books, door to door. </p>
              <p>On January of 1950, Hawk said <i>good-bye</i> to his
                mother and his friends and struck out for Los Angeles,
                California, with the expectations of going to India. His
                readings of Overstreet, Besant, Bruton,
                Leadbetter,Yogananda, Ouspensky and Gurdijeff. Along
                with the five volume set of <b>The Teachings Of The
                  Masters</b> by Baird Spaulding fueled the fires of his
                searching. He felt that the answers to some of the many
                questions, that were always with him, might be found in
                the mysteries of India and Tibet. He and a friend, he
                had met while selling, by the name of Ralph Bernesser
                left Albany, New York in the dead of winter for the
                sunny shores of California. "Young men, go west." </p>
              <p>They carried an appropriate sign:<i> "California or
                  Bust"</i>, not original but effective. After about
                five months of hitch-hiking and knocking around across
                the country. The two road worn veterans pulled into Los
                Angeles, California, flat broke, not even two Abraham
                Lincolns' to rub together. They had enough presence of
                mind to ship two footlockers ahead, prepaid. Within two
                days, Ralph had gotten a job slinging hash at Walgreens
                on Broadway and a day later Hawk landed a job at
                Clifftons' Cafeteria washing pots and pans and making
                coffee, "<i>"chop, chop"</i>. Salary, a big whopping,
                twenty dollars a week plus two meals a day. He worked
                from three in the morning till noon. </p>
              <p>To hurry the events along, Ralph and Hawk never
                experienced the sunset over the Ganges or the Taj Mahal,
                let alone the peaks of the Himalayas. Ralph made a
                marriage decision that took place somewhere south of the
                belt buckle, that's according to wither you are standing
                up or lying down. But what is new about that? The road
                warriors finally lost contact. Hawk left the cafeteria
                after answering an intriguing advertisement about a job
                offer that read: "Wanted a photographers' assistant,
                must be well groomed and well spoken, strong and
                reliable, a social person able to mix and adjust to the
                hours and the schedule. All expenses paid, plus a salary
                . Own private quarters. If interested, please call for
                an appointment." </p>
              <p>Which He did and landed the job. </p>
              <p>The pay was $100 per week, plus expenses, plus
                quarters. Bert and his mother lived in the main part of
                the house and what a house! I had only seen a house like
                this in the magazines I used to sell. It had a swimming
                pool; one of those kidney shaped kind, a couple of
                cabanas, and a bar the whole nine yards. There was a
                chef, maid, a houseboy, a pool maintenance man and a
                gardener - a tough life!!! </p>
              <p>Bert Kopperl Jr. was a real live Hollywood
                Photographer. At one time, before the War he worked for
                <b>Life Magazine</b> under Margaret Burke White. But
                during the Second World War, while he was stationed in
                the Philippines, he became ill with Polio. It left him
                paralyzed from head to toe. He was told at the time,
                that he would never take another photograph again. But
                once Bert reached stateside, he was determined to prove
                the doctors wrong. He set about doing a routine of
                exercises mixed with intense stretching sessions. Within
                six months, Bert was moving his upper torso then came
                movement in his arms and hands. He built on each small
                success. Before, he could not even hold or control a
                pencil. Every movement took a great effort of focusing.
                I believed then and I still believe that Bert willed the
                movements and his recovery. He endured the tremendous
                pain of having all his tendons stretched daily, but it
                paid off. Bert improved each and every day. Bert was the
                personification of "Emile Coue' famous words; "Every day
                in every way, I am getting better and better".</p>
              <p>A special wheelchair was designed for Bert, so a tripod
                could be attached to one of the legs and arms of the
                wheelchair for mounting a "Portrait Camera". With
                practice, Bert finally was able to take pictures again.
                His skills at writing and eating, were also improving.
                Bert was a lesson in self-determination and the "Power
                of a directed "Will". He had refused to accept defeat in
                the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. </p>
              <p>My job was to get Bert into his wheelchair and out of
                it, into a car. Plus setting up the lights for the photo
                shoot, Once we arrived on the scene and Bert was in his
                chair, he took over. He did not want to be wheeled
                around, he would do it himself. </p>
              <p>Bert had developed a process called "Canvagraph" After
                the taking of a black and white photograph; he would
                take the negative of that photograph and transfer it to
                a sheet of sensitized canvas, then it was painted in
                oils. So now we have a photograph that becomes an oil
                painting, with the texture and the look of a real oil
                painting. Not an interpretation of some artist, but a
                true image of the person. </p>
              <p>I was like a country bumpkin at a County Fair. I had
                always been a great Movie fan all my life, and here I
                was "right mack dab" in the middle of "all the glitz and
                glamour". I was speaking to the "Rich and Famous". I
                used to say to Bert, "I must dreaming and if not, do not
                wake me up". </p>
              <div>We went to all the fashionable places frequented by
                the stars; Chasen's, the Brown Derby, Romanoff's,
                Macambo's, Ciros' and the Coppa Cabanna. On the weekends
                we would alternate between driving down to Palm Springs
                to the Racquet Club or opted to go out to the John Ford
                Ranch in San Fernando Valley. One of my favorite places.
                If we were lucky; both Ford and John Wayne would be at
                the Ranch along with others ; Ben Johnson, Chill Wills,
                Ward Bond, Grant Withers, Dobe Carey and many of the
                other supporting actors that were usually in all of
                Wayne's pictures. Sometimes, Lee Marvin would show up. I
                had a very hard time keeping my mouth from flying open
                and my eyes from staring. </div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>The "Racquet Club" was managed by Charlie Farrell.
                Some might remember him in a Television series in the
                States called <b>My Little Margie</b> starring Gail
                Storm. Also in a "Twenties" film where he played
                opposite Janet Gaynor in a movie called <b>Leave Her To
                  Heaven</b>. Humphrey Bogart and Ralph Bellamy were on
                the Board of the Club and were responsible for getting
                Bert a membership card to the club. </div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div>Going to all the places in and around Hollywood and
                the Beverly Hills area. Plus the Racquet Club was how
                Bert would generate business. When we would arrive at
                the Club. I would get Bert into his chair and he was on
                his own. I never got over the awe of being around the
                Movie greats, whom I had watched as a kid in a movie
                house, in Greencastle, Indiana; where I paid a dime to
                see a full length feature film, a "Pathe News" Reel,
                "Time Marches On", A Cartoon, a Short Subject feature
                and the Saturday afternoon serial; "Flash Gordon and The
                Martians". </div>
              <p>Bert also did a lot of the still shots on the set for
                the Studios and for the many movie magazines that were
                in vogue at the time. one of Bert's 'black and whites'
                was instrumental in getting a young man a screen test
                for a movie called; <b>'This Gun For Hire'</b> starring
                Veronica Lake. The young man's name was Alan Ladd. </p>
              <p>The job, the environment and watching the raw courage
                and the determination displayed on a daily basis by Bert
                in overcoming the impossible. Left its' impression.
                Living and working among the "Hollywood" famous gave me
                an education that one does not get in the classroom. </p>
              <p>I met some great people in Hollywood, the list is to
                long to enumerate. But one name, one person who made a
                great impression on me. In the way he treated people,
                along with his humility mixed with his Stardom. Made me
                a lifetime fan. Bert and I went out to his home in San
                Fernando Valley, one day to meet both his wife and
                children, for a picture shoot. After the photographs
                were taken, we were shown around the house. Then he took
                us to his Trophy and Awards' room. I could have spent
                the whole day just looking and asking a million
                questions. His name, if you have not guessed by now, was
                Mr. Robert (Bob) Hope, a gentleman in the truest sense
                of the word. "Thank you."</p>
              <div>To illustrate: <br>
              </div>
              <div>Bert and I were at the Racquet Club on a New Years'
                Eve, and Mr Hope was there with some of his overseas
                troupe. They had just returned from entertaining the
                troops and filming their Christmas Show. Mr Hope had
                stopped at our table to say "<i>hello"</i> and mentioned
                that they had flown in from Okinawa. I asked where they
                had landed, and Mr Hope replied that he was not quite
                sure where they had landed. But he said; "that he would
                go back to his table and get his pilot". This man, Mr
                Hope went all the way back to his table through that New
                Years' Eve crowd and brought his pilot back to answer my
                questions. That was class, it surely impressed the hell
                out of me.( "hell" by the way is a Biblical word) </div>
              <p>There were many other show types that would not give
                you the time of day, unless you were somebody who could
                benefit their career, or that certain "someone" to be
                seen with for the rag columns. So many of these did not
                have the talent or the staying power. They were quickly:
                "<i>what's his/her name?"</i> </p>
              <p>Bert learned one afternoon, pool side at the "Racquet
                Club" from Henry King, the famous Band leader of the
                "Henry King Orchestra" which was at that time playing an
                engagement at the <b>Shamrock Hotel</b> in Houston,
                Texas. Mr King told Bert that Houston was the placed to
                be; where the money was flowing like the "Texas Crude".
                So Bert the smart business man and the opportunist that
                he was, decided it was time to visit the "wide open
                spaces" of Texas . So off to Texas we went, Bert, his
                mother flew and I drove the Buick convertible to Texas </p>
              <p>Upon arriving at the Shamrock Hotel, the owner himself
                of this "<i>Glitz and Glitter" Hotel</i> met us and
                offered a suite of rooms, near his Penthouse. The "man"
                was Glenn McCarthy, ex-wild catter who struck it rich,
                and married into the prominent "Lee" Family. But the
                River Oaks' high society never quite "cottoned" {that's
                Texan for "who he?"}. Glenn, remained an outsider. So
                Mr. McCarthy, ups and builds the Shamrock Hotel, the
                "Talk of the Town". </p>
              <p>For the Gala Opening, Glenn flew in several plane loads
                of Movie Stars and other notables. Around this same
                time; Edna Ferber, had written a Novel entitled <strong>"
                  The Giant"</strong>, which became a Movie starring;
                Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, James Dean and Mercedes
                McBride. The character that James Dean played was a
                characture of Glenn Mc Carthy. To say that the oil
                aristocracy was a little miffed at Ferber and her broad
                strokes of the Oil World of Texas would be putting it
                mildly. </p>
              <p>But back to the story; when Bert was photographing the
                stars in Hollywood and selling his <i>Canvagraph</i>
                portraits, he always made a duplicate of the photographs
                and or the portraits. When we decided to make the jump
                to Texas, Bert crated up all his works and sent them on
                ahead. The Management gave Bert all the space he needed
                throughout the Hotel to hang his photographs and
                portraits. Of course the first order of business was to
                do a portrait of the Man himself Mr.Glenn McCarthy and
                have it hung in a prominent place in the Lobby. The
                majority of the Stars portraits were hung in "The Gift
                Shop" which had to be passed on the way into the Private
                <b>Cork Club</b>, the "Watering Hole" for the moneyed
                people of Texas. As you went by the Gift Shop , you
                could see the portraits and pictures of Gary Grant,
                Ginger Rogers, Allan Ladd, Rita Hayworth, Jane Russell,
                Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and the
                list goes on. </p>
              <p>Well, you can guess the rest of the Story. Everyone had
                to have their picture taken by Bert Kopperl, the famous
                Hollywood Photographer, who shot the stars. An
                appointment was harder to get than the "liquid gold" out
                of the ground of Texas. We were flooded with
                appointments. Bert's prices went from 500 dollars a
                portrait, to a thousand or more. Black and whites
                started at 500 dollars. I worked six months without a
                day off. I seldom saw anything beyond the grounds of the
                Shamrock. Besides the pace of the day and the night; the
                invitations, the dinners, the big parties thrown by
                Glenn Mc Carthy in the Emerald Room, the endless nights
                in the Cork Club; the side trips to the Casinos in
                Galveston, all of this took its' toll. I finally told
                Bert after we had moved out of the Shamrock and were
                living in the suburbs. That I would help train someone
                to take my place. But I needed out, my health was more
                important. Words were exchanged, but I held firm. I left
                the job and a great employer and a friend. But I had to
                get another life. My love life had become '<i>what the
                  little boy shot at and missed'</i>. It was almost
                non-existent, almost. </p>
              <p>After leaving a most incredible job, I landed a job
                that I was familiar with and good at; selling ladies
                shoes at "Chandlers". Also there was a hidden agenda in
                my choice...Ladies, lots and lots of ladies, in and out
                the doors. But as, all past alumni of shoe salesmen
                know, there are those moments of insanity connected to
                the business. Where you have those ladies, who would try
                on almost every shoe in the store and then walk out.
                Only to come back about closing time and say; "would you
                please show me that pair shoes I like so much this
                morning." As if they were the only person you had waited
                on the entire day. And they would get downright
                indignant if you didn't remember them. Or you had those
                who would say: "I like the Baby doll toe on number 240,
                the heel on 024 and the sling on 400. Do you have
                anything like that. Finally out of desperation after
                pulling out every shoe in the stockroom. I would get a
                pencil and paper and ask: "If you will draw it, I will
                order it from the factory." And then there were those,
                who after measuring their foot would insist that you had
                made a mistake in measuring the shoe size. They worn a
                size 5AA, so you would get the 5AA. And they would try
                to squeeze a 6 1/2 Benny foot into the 5 AA. Then say;
                wrap it up. Before the store would open the following
                morning, that same lady who insisted on wearing the 5
                AA. Was standing outside on crutches, waiting to tell
                you that you had sold her "shoes that were to small for
                her." Such is the life of a ladies' shoe salesman. But
                it had its' perks, only an ex-shoe salesman "knows" what
                I do say! </p>
              <p>Working in the same store, was a dark-eyed beauty with
                that "southern comfort look". Her name was Barbara, it
                was just one of those things. That kind of feeling that
                just walks right up and says; <i>What are you doing
                  tonight and a few hundred more nights after that?</i>
                Barbara and I became an item, with no strings attached.
                It was a five; "June, moon", croon type of months. I
                wrote the note, to say goodbye, it was getting to
                serious. I needed some breathing space. </p>
              <p>After a couple of months, maybe three, I answered an
                employment ad. And an interview was set up. I got the
                job, better pay, base salary and commission. It was
                selling advertisement for a new TV Digest called <b>Televiews</b>
                which was owned by a Larry Peavy. Travis McKinney was
                the then Managing Editor. And Jeff Osborne was the
                Circulation Manager. In those days, Houston had but one
                Television Station. Larry Boesh, Bill Newkirk and Dick
                Gottleib of the TV Station were contributing columnists
                to the magazine. </p>
              <p>About a month after starting the job, the Circulation
                Manager left, I asked for the job and got it. I learned
                early in life, even before entering the Army. That there
                are certain things that are essential if you want to
                advance in a job. Do the job better than your
                predecessor and do more than what is required. Plus,
                learn and help in all the different phases of the
                operation. Pick everybody's brain by asking questions,
                more questions and watching how different operations are
                done. And if you really want another position in the
                company, research everything pertaining to the job you
                are after. These were essential for me, for I was always
                in competition with those, who either had the experience
                or the academic credentials, or both. </p>
              <p>When a job opening came up, that I particularly wanted,
                I would go to the owner if possible, and asked for the
                chance to prove that I was capable of performing the
                task in question, Based on my present work record and
                output. And that I would do the new job at my present
                salary. And that upon proving my worth, I wanted an
                equitable salary in line with the new position. I would
                always asked for a specific time trial. That is how I
                got the jobs I had, without a High School or a College
                diploma. </p>
              <p>Travis eventually left the Managing Editors position.
                he had received an offer from a large International oil
                company to oversee the companies in-house publications.
                I dialed up my system and asked for a months' trial as
                Managing Editor. I said; if the magazine didn't improve
                in appearance and in circulation, I would stand down. I
                became the Managing Editor. </p>
              <p>KPRC-TV was still the only station in Town. All of us
                on the magazine was hoping for another TV Station. There
                had been rumors for months that another Station was in
                the hopper, but that was all, they were only rumors. </p>
              <p>Within this same time frame; Bert contacted me and
                asked what would it take for me to return and drive he
                and his mother to Las Vegas, Nevada? He had decided to
                extract some of the coin from the big Club Owners. And
                also do some portraits of the Headliners that were
                entertaining at the Casinos. I asked if I could write
                the terms of the contract; with the understanding that
                after the shoot was over. I would be released from the
                contract. Bert agreed to the terms and the release
                clause. I conferred with Larry Peavy and found out that
                he had been thinking of selling the Magazine. And that
                he was going to ask if I would stay after the sale. I
                said, no. We parted friends and I accepted Bert's offer.
                <i>Vive,Las Vegas!</i> </p>
              <p>Bert had contacted a friend, Bryon Foy; a Hollywood
                Producer, one of the seven Foy brothers Who was the
                owner of the Bar- W Guest Ranch, just outside of Vegas.
                Twelve miles from the Flamingo Club, the first Casino to
                be built in Las Vegas. </p>
              <p>We arrived in Vegas around January of 1952. Bert
                immediately went about lining up the Club owners. But
                like before, the lifestyle and the hours became to much.
                I was more than ready when Bert announced that he and
                his mother were heading back to Los Angeles. He asked if
                I wanted to accompany he and his mother. I reminded him
                of the release clause and declined. I stayed on at the
                Guest Ranch, as a guest. </p>
              <p>After getting bored out of my mind, with the same
                routine night in and night out. And going to the Casinos
                during the day and a little golf at the newly opened
                Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn Casino. I asked Bob Ryan the
                Resident Manager, if there was something I could do or
                help out around the Ranch. Well, he said; we are going
                to do some renovating and build some new cottages. I
                said; fine, l will help in the remodeling. He remarked
                that Bryon wouldn't be to happy, your a paying guest. I
                waved his remarks and started in helping in the
                renovating. Two weeks later, Bryon and Carter the CPA
                showed up. And Bryon asked <i>Is that Mc Ginnie out
                  there working? Why is he working?</i> Bob said; <i>you'll
                  have to ask him.</i> Byron came out and asked; <i>if
                  you want a job, help Bob , you can be his assistant.
                  He going to be leaving on vacation. If you can learn
                  what has to be done by the time he leaves, you can run
                  the Ranch while he is gone.</i> Okay! </p>
              <p>In three months, I took over as Resident Manager. I had
                picked Ryan's brain. I had talked to Jakie Freeman, the
                owner of the newly built "Sands Hotel" and Casino". I
                had met him when I had worked for Bert. He had owned the
                " Balinese Casino" between Houston and Galveston,Texas.
                Mr Freeman introduced me to his Food and Bar Manager, I
                asked as many question as he would allow; took notes as
                fast as I could. I did this with several Clubs on the
                Strip. </p>
              <p>Let's backtrack a little bit, when Ryan went on
                Vacation, Mr Carter, Bryon's CPA found a few
                discrepancies in the books. It was at this point, I
                asked for the position and a trial period. </p>
              <p>After becoming Manager, I turned the Guest Ranch into a
                retreat for divorcees, who were seeking a six week
                residency requirement for their Vegas divorce. We filled
                the Guest Ranch. The Bar -W became a popular eating
                place and bar, for the single men of Vegas. A "Rounders"
                paradise; forty acres, of green grass and trees,
                swimming pool, tennis courts, rustic cottages and a
                Lodge. No gambling, not even one slot machine. We had
                reserved some of the cottages for permanent residents
                who worked on the Strip. One of the Ranches' charms was
                its' location. We were twelve miles out away from the
                clinging and clanging of the one armed bandits. It was a
                perfect hideaway. We were open Twenty-four hours a day.
              </p>
              <p>While at the Guest Ranch, in the earlier months, I had
                been corresponding with a young lady, I had met and
                dated while in Houston. She had returned back to
                Atlanta, Georgia, where her parents were living. I had
                never met the family. I had only met one of the aunts in
                Houston when I would go to pick her up. I proposed by
                letter and phone and asked her to join me in Las Vegas.
                So we could get married. <br>
